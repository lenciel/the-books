We (John and Jason) have seen the North Star Framework offer many benefits to teams and businesses: better alignment, clearer prioritization, and less wasted work.

我们(John 和 Jason)已经看到 North Star Framework 为团队和业务提供了许多好处: 更好的协调、更清晰的优先级排序和更少的浪费工作。

What we like most about the North Star Framework, though, is the way it inspires valuable conversations. To identify, design, and implement their North Star, teams step away from screens, Jira tickets, and status updates, and they spend time deeply engaged with one another—sharing ideas and learning.

然而，我们最喜欢北极星框架的是它激发有价值的对话的方式。为了识别、设计和实现他们的北极星，团队远离屏幕、 Jira Ticket 和状态更新，他们花时间深入互动ーー分享想法和学习。

Yes, the framework and workshop are intentionally oversimplified. Yes, unpacking your product strategy is hard. And yes, you will leave the room with nagging disagreements. But through this work you’ll have meaningful conversations: about beliefs and assumptions, strategy and value exchanges, users and customers, Inputs and outputs, leading and lagging, your game and your bets. In these conversations you’ll discover what matters to teammates, customers, and business—and as a result, you’ll build better products.

是的，框架和工作坊有意过于简化。是的，打开你的产品策略是困难的。是的，离开房间的时候，你会带着纠缠不休的分歧。但是通过这项工作，你会有有意义的对话: 关于信念和假设，战略和价值交换，用户和客户，投入和产出，领先和滞后，你的游戏和你的赌注。在这些谈话中，你会发现什么对团队成员、客户和业务最重要ーー因此，你会生产出更好的产品。

The quality of your conversations is the real secret to the North Star—the North Star of the North Star.

你们谈话的质量是北极星的北极星——北极星的真正秘密。

Think of all the decisions your team makes weekly. Hundreds? Thousands? Imagine improving those decisions—big and small—even incrementally. You’ll see better results for you, your team, your company, and your customers.

想想你的团队每周做出的所有决定。几百个？ 成千上万？ 想象一下，改进这些决定ーー无论大小ーー甚至是递增的。你会看到更好的结果为你，你的团队，你的公司和你的客户。

American cyclist Greg Lemond, two-time world champion and three-time Tour de France winner, famously remarked that, 「Cycling never gets easier, you just go faster.」 Think about this quote as it relates to product. We shouldn’t expect product work to get easier, but we can find ways to make it better, to focus on the meaningful, impactful hard work—the 「true work.」

两届世界冠军、三届环法自行车赛冠军、美国自行车运动员格雷格•莱蒙德曾说过一句名言: 「骑自行车永远不会变得更容易，你只会跑得更快。」 考虑一下这个与产品相关的报价。我们不应指望产品工作会变得更容易，但我们可以找到方法让它变得更好，专注于有意义、有影响力的艰苦工作——「真正的工作」

Recently, we spoke with a senior engineer who was frustrated. Her team was in the middle of quarterly planning, and her manager and the VP of Product had just spent their last meeting talking about empowerment, OKRs, and the importance of goal-setting. She described her frustration:

最近，我们采访了一位感到沮丧的高级工程师。她的团队正在制定季度计划，她的经理和产品副总裁刚刚开完最后一次会议，讨论授权、 OKRs 和目标设定的重要性。她描述了自己的挫败感:

「It feels like they equate empowerment to just letting us do what we want, and then getting nervous—or angry even—when what we do isn’t what they would have done. That is not how I view real empowerment. We’re just spinning our wheels at the moment.」 

「感觉上，他们把赋能等价于让我们做自己想做的事情，并感到紧张，甚至愤怒——因为当我们做的事情不是他们做的那样或者结果不好时，压力就随之而来。这不是我对真正的赋能的看法。我们只是在打转。」

She went on to describe her view of real empowerment as containing context, a well thought-out strategy, and no sugar-coating. She didn’t want work to be easier; rather, she wanted her work to have more impact. This is the perfect scenario for frameworks like the North Star Framework.

她接着说，她认为真正的赋能是包含背景和上下文的，是在一个经过深思熟虑的战略下进行尝试，而不是一种糖衣炮弹。她不想让工作变得更简单，相反，她想让自己的工作产生更大的影响。对于像 North Star Framework 这样的框架来说，这是一个完美的场景。

We arranged a short session with her, the VP of Product, the product manager on the team, a designer, and a data scientist from a different product within the company (a neutral third party can be a welcome addition). Within 30 minutes they were exploring some foundational company bets—things they all knew about but that they hadn’t really discussed.

我们安排了一个简短的会议，与她，副总裁的产品，产品经理的团队，设计师，和一个数据科学家从不同的产品在公司(一个中立的第三方可以是一个受欢迎的增加)。不到30分钟，他们就开始探索一些公司的基本赌注ーー那些他们都知道但没有真正讨论过的事情。

It turned out that the VP of Product was a natural at this kind of strategy gymnastics, but had never really had the opportunity to share that skill. The data scientist talked them out of getting too theoretical (「As much as I want to dig into this…」). The designer challenged some assumptions about their chosen value exchanges (「We don’t know that, and need to do more research」). In 60 minutes, they had a couple of North Star Metric candidates on the table. We skipped around the workshop format—trying Inputs, tweaking the North Star Metric, arguing about 「the game,」 and tweaking the formula. They were on their way.

事实证明，产品副总裁在这种战略体操方面是天生的，但从来没有真正有机会分享这种技能。数据科学家说服他们不要过于理论化(「尽管我很想深入研究这个... ... 」)。设计师对他们选择的价值交换的一些假设提出了质疑(「我们不知道，需要做更多的研究」)。在60分钟内，他们有了几个北极星度量的备选项在桌上。我们甚至不需要进行工作坊常常需要进行的内容ーー尝试输入要素，调整北极星指标，争论到底是哪种「游戏」 ，调整公式——他们就已经在路上了。

We checked in with the senior engineer a couple of months later. Things weren’t perfect, but they were better. She didn’t 「feel like [the team] was making stuff up anymore.」 Though some features they shipped didn’t have the intended impact, the team learned important insights about what customers valued, and the senior engineer shared that it 「was pretty valuable information, because those were kind of sacred cows.」 She was starting to feel 「real empowerment.」

几个月后，我们向高级工程师询问进展。事情并不完美，但是他们做得更好。她不再「觉得(这个团队)在胡编乱造」 虽然他们提供的一些功能并没有达到预期的效果，但是团队了解到了客户看重什么的重要见解，这位高级工程师分享说，这些信息「非常有价值，因为那些是神圣不可侵犯的」。她开始感觉到「真正的被赋能」。

To reframe Lemond: Product work never gets easier, you’ll just have more impact—and maybe a bit more sanity, flow, and satisfaction.

重塑莱蒙德: 产品工作永远不会变得更容易，你只会有更大的影响力，也许会更加理智、流畅和满意。

You can do this.

你能做到的。
