All this talk about good words and bad words brings us to a gray but important area called "usage." What is good usage? What is good English? What newly minted words is it O.K. to use, and who is to be the judge? Is it O.K. to use "O.K."?

所有这些关于好词和坏词的讨论，把我们带到了一个灰色但重要的领域，叫做“用法”。什么是好的用法？ 什么是好的英语？ 用什么新词是可以的，谁来评判呢？ 用“O.K.”可以吗？

Earlier I mentioned an incident of college students hassling the administration, and in the last chapter I described myself as a word freak. Here are two fairly recent arrivals. "Hassle" is both a verb and a noun, meaning to give somebody a hard time, or the act of being given a hard time, and anyone who has ever been hassled for not properly filling out Form 35-BX will agree that the word sounds exactly right. "Freak" means an enthusiast, and there's no missing the aura of obsession that goes with call­ ing someone a jazz freak, or a chess freak, or a sun freak, though it would probably be pushing my luck to describe a man who compulsively visits circus sideshows as a freak freak.

早些时候，我提到一个大学生骚扰行政部门的事件，在最后一章，我把自己描述为一个词语狂。 这里是两个相当新近到达的。 “Hassle”既是一个动词也是一个名词，意思是让某人难堪，或者让某人难堪的行为，曾经因为没有正确填写表格35-BX 而受到麻烦的任何人都会同意这个词听起来非常正确。 “Freak”的意思是一个狂热爱好者，把某人称为爵士乐迷、象棋迷或者太阳怪人是一种痴迷的光环，尽管把一个强迫性地去马戏团的杂耍表演的男人描述成一个怪物可能会把我的运气推到极限。

Anyway, I accept these two usages gladly. I don't consider them slang, or put quotation marks around them to show that I'm mucking about in the argot of the youth culture and really know better. They're good words and we need them. But I won't accept "notables" and "greats" and "upcoming" and many other newcomers. They are cheap words and we don't need them.

无论如何，我欣然接受这两种用法。 我不认为它们是俚语，也不在它们旁边加引号，以表明我在年轻文化的暗语中胡闹，而且真的知道得更多。 这些都是好话，我们需要它们。 但我不会接受“知名人士”、“伟大人物”、“即将到来的人”以及其他许多新人。 它们是廉价的词汇，我们不需要它们。

Why is one word good and another word cheap? I can't give you an answer, because usage has no fixed boundaries. Lan­guage is a fabric that changes from one week to another, adding new strands and dropping old ones, and even word freaks fight over what is allowable, often reaching their decision on a wholly subjective basis such as taste ("notables" is sleazy). Which still leaves the question of who our tastemakers are.

为什么一个词好，另一个词便宜？ 我不能给你一个答案，因为用法没有固定的界限。 语言是一种结构，从一周到另一周不断变化，增加新的线索，放弃旧的线索，甚至字的怪胎争夺什么是允许的，往往达成他们的决定完全主观的基础上，如品味(“知名人士”是低俗的)。 这仍然留下了一个问题: 谁是我们的时尚缔造者。

The question was confronted by the editors of a brand-new dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary, at the outset of their task in the mid-1960s. They assembled a "'Usage Panel" to help them appraise the new words and dubious constructions that had come knocking at the door. Which ones should be ushered in, which thrown out on their ear? The panel consisted of 104 men and women-mostly writers, poets, editors and teach­ers who were known for caring about the language and trying to use it well. I was a member of the panel, and over the next few years I kept getting questionnaires. Would I accept "final­ize" and "escalate"? How did I feel about "It's me"? Would I allow "like" to be used as a conjunction-like so many people do? How about "mighty," as in "mighty fine"?

20世纪60年代中期，全新的词典《美国传统词典》(The American Heritage Dictionary)刚开始编纂时，编辑们就遇到了这个问题。 他们组织了一个“使用小组”来帮助他们评估敲门的新词和可疑的结构。 哪些人应该被引导进来，哪些人应该被抛弃在他们的耳边？ 该小组由104名男女组成，其中大多数是作家、诗人、编辑和教师，他们以关心语言和努力使用语言而闻名。 我是这个小组的成员，在接下来的几年里，我不断收到问卷。 我会接受“敲定”和“升级”吗？ 我对”是我”的感觉如何？ 我会像很多人那样，允许“喜欢”作为连词使用吗？ ”非常非常好”怎么样？

We were told that in the dictionary our opinions would be tab­ulated in a separate "Usage Note," so that readers could see how we voted. The questionnaire also left room for any comments we might feel impelled to make-a chance that the panelists seized avidly, as we found when the dictionary was published and our comments were released to the press. Passions ran high. "Good God, no! Never!" cried Barbara W. Tuchman, asked about the verb "to author." Scholarship hath no fury like that of a language purist faced with sludge, and I shared Tuchman's vow that "author" should never be authorized, just as I agreed with Lewis Mumford that the adverb "good" should be "left as the exclusive property of Ernest Hemingway."

我们被告知，在字典中，我们的意见将被单独列成表格，以便读者可以看到我们是如何投票的。 调查问卷还为我们可能觉得有必要提出的任何评论留出了空间——正如我们在字典出版和我们的评论向新闻界发布时所发现的那样，这是小组成员贪婪地抓住的一个机会。 情绪高涨。 “上帝啊，不！ 永远不会! ” 当被问及动词“ to author”时，巴巴拉·塔奇曼哭了起来 我和塔奇曼一样，发誓永远不要授权“作者” ，就像我和刘易斯 · 芒福德一样，认为副词“ good”应该“留给欧内斯特·海明威独有的财产”

But guardians of usage are doing only half their job if they merely keep the language from becoming sloppy. Any dolt can rule that the suffix "wise," as in "healthwise," is doltwise, or that being "rather unique" is no more possible than being rather pregnant. The other half of the job is to help the language grow by welcoming any immigrant that will bring ·strength or color. Therefore I was glad that 97 percent of us voted to admit "dropout," which is clean and vivid, but that only 47 percent would accept "senior citizen," which is typical of the pudgy new intruders from the land of sociology, where an illegal alien is now an undocumented resident. I'm glad we accepted "esca­late," the kind of verbal contraption I generally dislike but which the Vietnam war endowed with a precise meaning, complete with overtones of blunder.

但是，如果使用守护者仅仅是为了防止语言变得粗糙，他们的工作只完成了一半。 任何傻瓜都可以规定 suflix“明智” ，如“健康智慧” ，是傻瓜，或“相当独特”是不可能比怀孕更多。 另一半工作是通过欢迎任何能带来力量和肤色的移民来帮助语言的发展。 因此，我很高兴我们中有97% 的人投票承认“辍学” ，这个词干净而生动，但只有47% 的人会接受“老年公民” ，这是社会学领域新入侵者的典型特征，在这个领域，非法移民现在是非法居民。 我很高兴我们接受了“逐步升级” ，这种我通常不喜欢的口头装置，但越南战争赋予了它一个精确的修饰，完成了错误的暗示。

I'm glad we took into full membership . all sorts of robust words that previous dictionaries derided as "colloquial": adjec­tives like "rambunctious," verbs like "trigger" and "rile," nouns like "shambles" and "tycoon" and "trek," the latter approved by 78 percent to mean any difficult trip, as in "the commuter's daily trek to Manhattan." Originally it was a Cape Dutch word applied to the Boers' arduous journey by ox wagon. But our panel evidently felt that the Manhattan commuter's daily trek is no less arduous.

我很高兴我们成为正式会员。 以前的字典嘲笑它们是“口语化的” : 形容词有“喧闹的” ，动词有“触发的”和“激怒的” ，名词有“混乱的”、“大亨”和“徒步旅行” ，后者被78% 的人认为是指任何艰难的旅行，比如“通勤者每天去曼哈顿的徒步旅行” 最初它是一个开普荷兰语单词，用来形容布尔人乘坐牛车的艰苦旅程。 但我们的座谈小组显然认为，曼哈顿通勤者的每日艰苦跋涉丝毫没有减少。

Still, 22 percent were unwilling to let "trek" slip into general usage. That was the virtue of revealing how our panel voted­ it put our opinions on display, and writers in doubt can con­ duct themselves accordingly. Thus our 95 percent vote against "myself," as in "He invited Mary and myself to dinner," a word condemned as "prissy," "horrible" and "a genteelism," ought to warn off anyone who doesn't want to be prissy, horrible and gen­teel. As Red Smith put it, "'Myself is the refuge of idiots taught early that 'me' is a dirty word."

尽管如此，仍有22% 的人不愿意让“艰苦跋涉”成为普遍的用途。 这就是揭示我们的小组是如何投票的好处，它把我们的意见展示出来，有疑问的作者可以相应地欺骗自己。 因此，我们95% 的人投票反对“我自己” ，比如“他邀请玛丽和我共进晚餐” ，这个词被谴责为“拘谨”、“可怕”和“绅士主义” ，它应该警告那些不想表现得拘谨、可怕和有教养的人。 正如瑞德 · 史密斯所说，“‘我自己是白痴的避难所，很早就被教导‘我’是一个肮脏的词。”

On the other hand, only 66 percent of our panel rejected the verb "to contact," once regarded as tacky, and only half opposed the split infinitive and the verbs "to fault" and "to bus." So only 50 percent of your readers will fault you if you decide to volun­tarily call your school board and to bus your children to another town. If you contact your school board you risk your reputation by another 16 percent. Our apparent rule of thumb was stated by Theodore M. Bernstein, author of the excellent The Careful Writer: 'We should apply the test of convenience. Does the word fill a real need? If it does, let's give it a franchise."

另一方面，只有66% 的受访者反对使用动词“ to contact” ，这个词曾被认为是俗气的，只有一半的人反对使用分离不定词和动词“ to fault”和“ to bus” 因此，如果你决定自愿打电话给学校董事会，把你的孩子送到另一个城市，只有50% 的读者会责怪你。 如果你联系你的校董事会，你的声誉将面临另外16% 的风险。 优秀的《谨慎的作家》一书的作者西奥多 · m · 伯恩斯坦指出了我们明显的经验法则: 我们应该应用便利性测试。 这个词是否满足了真正的需求？ 如果是这样的话，我们就给它一个特权。”

All of this confirms what lexicographers have always known: that the laws of usage are relative, bending with the taste of the lawmaker. One of our panelists, Katherine Anne Porter, called "O.K." a "detestable vulgarity" and claimed she had never spoken the word in her life, whereas I freely admit that I have spoken the word "O.K." "Most," as in "most everyone," was scorned as "cute farmer talk" by Isaac Asimov and embraced as a "good English idiom" by Virgil Thomson. "Regime," meaning any administra­tion, as in "the Truman regime," drew the approval of most every­ one on the panel, as did "dynasty." But they drew the wrath of Jacques Barzun, who said, "These are technical terms, you blasted non-historians!" Probably I gave my O.K. to "regime." Now, chided by Barzun for imprecision, I think it looks like jour­nalese. One of the words I railed against was "personality," as in a "TV personality." But now I wonder if it isn't the only word for that vast swarm of people who are famous for being famous-and possibly nothing else. What do the Gabor sisters do?

所有这些都证实了词典编纂者一直以来所知道的: 使用法律是相对的，与立法者的口味相左。 我们的一个小组成员，凯瑟琳·安·波特 · 阿西莫夫，称“ o.k. ”是一个“可恶的粗话” ，并声称她一生中从未说过这个词，然而我坦率地承认，我说过“ o.k. ”这个词，就像“大多数人”一样，被艾萨克 · 阿西莫夫嘲笑为“可爱的农民谈话” ，被维吉尔 · 汤姆森称为“好的英语习语”。 “ Regime，”意思是任何政府，就像“杜鲁门政权”一样，得到了委员会中大多数人的认可，“ dynasty”也是如此 但是他们引起了雅克 · 巴尔赞的愤怒，他说: “这些都是技术术语，你们这些非历史学家! ” 也许我把我的 ok 给了“政权” 现在，由于巴尔赞的不精确性，我认为它看起来像是新闻术语。 我反对的一个词是“个性” ，就像“电视人物”一样 但是现在我想知道，这是不是唯一一个可以用来形容那一大群以出名而闻名的人的词——可能除此之外什么也没有。 伽伯姐妹是做什么的？

In the end it comes down to what is "correct" usage. We have no king to establish the King's English; we only have the President's English, which we don't want. Webster, long a defender of the faith, muddied the waters in 1961 with its per­ missive Third Edition, which argued that almost anything goes as long as somebody uses it, noting that "ain't" is "used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers."

归根结底，它归结为什么是“正确的”用法。 我们没有国王来建立国王的英语，我们只有总统的英语，我们不想要。 韦伯斯特，一个长期的基督教信念的捍卫者，在1961年用它的信函第三版搅浑了这片水域，认为几乎任何东西只要有人使用它，注意到“ ain’t”是“在美国大部分地区被许多有教养的演讲者口头使用”

Just where Webster cultivated those speakers I ain't sure. Nevertheless it's true that the spoken language is looser than the written language, and The American Heritage Dictionary prop­erly put its question to us in both forms. Often we allowed an oral idiom that we forbade in print as too informal, fully realizing, however, that "the pen must at length comply with the tongue," as Samuel Johnson said, and that today's spoken garbage may be tomorrow's written gold. The growing accep­tance of the split infinitive, or of the preposition at the end of a sentence, proves that formal syntax can't hold the fort forever against a speaker's more comfortable way of getting the same thing said-and shouldn't. I think a sentence is a fine thing to put a preposition at the end of.

我不知道韦伯斯特是在哪儿培养的那些演讲者。 尽管如此，口头语言确实比书面语言松散，《美国传统词典》正确地以这两种形式向我们提出了问题。 我们经常允许一个我们禁止印刷的口头习语过于非正式，然而，我们充分意识到，“笔必须最终服从舌头，”塞缪尔 · 约翰逊(Samuel Johnson)说，今天的口头垃圾可能是明天的书面黄金。 越来越多的人接受分离不定词，或者接受句子结尾的介词，这证明了正式的句法不能永远支撑着说话人舒服地说出同样的事情的方式，也不应该这样。 我认为把介词放在句末是一件好事。

Our panel recognized that correctness can even vary within a word. We voted heavily against "cohort" as a synonym for "col­ league," except where the tone was jocular. Thus a professor would not be among his cohorts at a faculty meeting, but they would abound at his college reunion, wearing funny hats. We rejected "too" as a synonym for "very," as in "His health is not too good." Whose health is? But we approved it in sardonic or humorous use, as in "He was not too happy when she ignored him."

我们的专家小组认识到，正确性甚至可以在一个单词中有所不同。 我们大力投票反对将“同龄人”作为“同盟”的同义词，除非其语气是诙谐的。 因此，教授不会出现在教员会议上，但他们会在大学同学聚会上大量出现，戴着滑稽的帽子。 我们拒绝将“ too”作为“ very”的同义词，例如“ His health is not too good. ” 谁的健康？ 但是我们用讽刺或幽默的方式表示赞同，比如“当她忽略他的时候，他很不高兴。”

These may seem like picayune distinctions. They're not. They are signals to the reader that you are sensitive to the shad­ings of usage. "Too" when substituted for "very" is clutter-"He didn't feel too much like going shopping." But the w:ry example in the previous paragraph is worthy of Ring Lardner. It adds a tinge of sarcasm that otherwise wouldn't be there.

这些可能看起来像是微不足道的区别。 事实并非如此。 它们是向读者发出的信号，表明你对使用的阴影很敏感。 “ Too”代替“ very”是混乱的——“他不太想去购物。” 但是前面一段中的 w: ry 例子是值得 Ring Lardner 使用的。 它增加了一丝讽刺的味道，否则就不会有这种感觉。

Luckily, a pattern emerged from the deliberations of our panel, and it offers a guideline that is still useful. We turned out to be liberal in accepting new words and phrases, but conserva­tive in grammar.

幸运的是，从我们小组的讨论中出现了一个模式，它提供了一个仍然有用的指导方针。 事实证明，我们在接受新单词和短语方面是开明的，但在语法方面却是保守的。

It would be foolish to reject a word as perfect as "dropout," or to pretend that countless words and phrases are not entering the gates of correct usage every day, borne on the winds of sci­ence and technology, fad and fashion and social change: "cyberspace," "meltdown," "skyjacker," "wetlands," "software," "fax," "macho," "yuppie," "gentrify" and hundreds of others. Nor should we forget all the short words invented by the counter cul­ture in the 1960s as a way of lashing back at the self-important verbiage of the Establishment: "trip," "rap," "crash," "trash," "funky," "split," "rip-off," "vibes," "downer," "bummer" and many more. If brevity is a prize, these were winners. The only trouble with accepting words that entered the language overnight is that they often leave just as abruptly. The "happenings" of the late 1960s no longer happen, "out of sight" is out of sight, and even "awesome" has begun to chill out. The writer who cares about usage must always know the quick from the dead.

拒绝一个像“辍学”这样完美的词，或者假装每天有无数的词汇和短语没有进入正确用法的大门，都是愚蠢的。这些词汇是由科学和技术、时尚和社会变革的风潮所带来的: “网络空间”、“崩溃”、“劫机者”、“湿地”、“软件”、“传真”、“男子气概”、“雅皮士”、“绅士化”等数以百计的词汇。 我们也不应该忘记20世纪60年代反主流文化发明的所有短词，这些短词是为了回击当权派那些自以为是的废话: “ trip”、“ rap”、“ crash”、“ trash”、“ funky”、“ split”、“ rip-off”、“ vibes”、“ downer”、“ bummer”等等。 如果简洁是一种奖励，那么这些人就是赢家。 接受一夜之间进入这门语言的单词的唯一困难是它们经常突然离开。 20世纪60年代后期的“意外事件”不再发生，“眼不见为净”不再出现，甚至“令人敬畏的”也开始冷却下来。 关心用法的作者必须总是能从死人中分辨出快者。

As for the area where our Usage Panel was conservative, we upheld most of the classic distinctions in grammar-"can" and "may," "fewer" and "less," "eldest" and "oldest," etc.-and decried the classic errors, insisting that "flout" still doesn't mean "flaunt," no matter how many writers flaunt their ignorance by flouting the rule, and that "fortuitous" still means "accidental," "disinterested" still means "impartial," and "infer" doesn't mean "imply." Here we were motivated by our love of the language's beautiful precision. Incorrect usage will lose you the readers you would most like to win. Know the difference between a "refer­ence" and an "allusion," between "connive" and "conspire," between "compare with" and "compare to." If you must use "comprise," use it right. It means "include"; dinner comprises meat, potatoes, salad and dessert.

至于我们的用法委员会是保守派的领域，我们支持大多数经典语法区分——“ can”和“ may”、“ less”和“ less”、“最年长”和“最古老”等等，并谴责这些经典错误，坚称“ flout”仍然不意味着“炫耀” ，不管有多少作者通过藐视规则来炫耀自己的无知，“偶然”仍然意味着“偶然” ，“无私”仍然意味着“公正” ，“公正”并不意味着“暗示” 在这里，我们被自己对语言美丽精确性的热爱所激励。 不正确的使用会让你失去你最想赢得的读者。 知道“提及”和“典故”之间的区别，知道“共谋”和“合谋”之间的区别，知道“比较”和“比较”之间的区别 如果你必须使用“ conclude” ，那就正确使用它。 它的意思是“包括” ; 晚餐包括肉、土豆、沙拉和甜点。

"I choose always the grammatical form unless it sounds affected," Marianne Moore explained, and that's finally where our panel took its stand. We were not pedants, so hung up on correctness that we didn't want the language to keep refreshing itself with phrases like "hung up." But that didn't mean we had to accept every atrocity that comes stumbling in.

“我总是选择语法形式，除非它听起来有影响，”玛丽安 · 穆尔解释说，这就是我们小组最终采取的立场。 我们不是书呆子，对正确性如此执着，以至于我们不希望语言中不断出现像“挂了”这样的词语 但是，这并不意味着我们必须接受每一个偶然出现的暴行。

Meanwhile the battle continues. In 1980 the Usage Panel was reconstituted, and today I still receive ballots soliciting my opinion on new locutions: verbs like "definitize" ("Congress definitized a proposal"), nouns like "affordables," colloquialisms like "the bottom line" and strays like "into" ("He's into backgam­ mon and she's into jogging").

与此同时，战斗还在继续。 1980年，用法小组重新组建，直到今天，我仍然收到关于新用法的投票，征求我的意见: 动词，如“定义化”(“国会确定了一项提案”) ，名词，如“可供选择” ，口语词，如“底线” ，以及迷路，如“进入”(“他进入 backgam mon，她进入慢跑”)。

It no longer takes a panel of experts to notice that jargon is flooding our daily life and language. President Carter signed an executive order directing that federal regulations be written "simply and clearly." President Clinton's attorney general, Janet Reno, urged the nation's lawyers to replace "a lot of legalese" with "small, old words that all people understand"-words like "right" and "wrong" and "justice." Corporations have hired consultants to make their prose less opaque, and even the insurance industry is trying to rewrite its policies to tell us in less disastrous English what redress will be ours when disaster strikes. Whether these efforts will do much good I wouldn't want to bet. Still, there's comfort in the sight of so many watch­ dogs standing Canute-like on the beach, trying to hold back the tide. That's where all careful writers ought to be-looking at every new piece of flotsam that washes up and asking "Do we need it?"

不再需要一个专家小组就能注意到，行话正充斥着我们的日常生活和语言。 卡特总统签署了一项行政命令，要求将联邦法规写得“简单明了” 克林顿总统的司法部长珍妮特 · 里诺(Janet Reno)敦促美国的律师们，用“所有人都能理解的小而古老的词汇”——比如“正确”、“错误”和“公正”——取代“许多法律术语” 公司已经雇佣了顾问来使他们的文章不那么晦涩难懂，甚至保险业也在试图重写他们的政策，用不那么灾难性的英语告诉我们当灾难来临时我们会得到什么样的补偿。 这些努力是否会带来很多好处，我不敢打赌。 尽管如此，看到这么多看门狗像克努特一样站在海滩上，试图阻挡潮水，还是让人感到舒服。 这就是所有细心的作家应该注意的地方——看着每一块新的残骸，问自己: “我们需要它吗? ”

I remember the first time somebody asked me, "How does that impact you?" I always thought "impact" was a noun, except in dentistry. Then I began to meet "de-impact," usually in connection with programs to de-impact the effects of some adversity. Nouns now tum overnight into verbs. We target goals and we access facts. Train conductors announce that the train won't platform. A sign on an airport door tells me that the door is alarmed. Companies are downsizing. It's part of an ongoing effort to grow the business. "Ongoing" is a jargon word whose main use is to raise morale. We face our daily job with more zest if the boss tells us it's an ongoing project; we give more willingly to institutions if they have targeted our funds for ongoing needs. Otherwise we might fall prey to disin­ centivization.

我记得第一次有人问我，“这对你有什么影响? ” 我一直以为“ impact”是个名词，除了在牙科里。 然后，我开始遇到“去冲击” ，通常是与减少一些不利影响的项目有关。 现在名词一夜之间变成了动词。 我们有目标，我们了解事实。 列车员报告说火车不站台了。 机场大门上的一个标志告诉我大门有警报。 公司正在缩减规模。 这是发展业务的持续努力的一部分。 “正在进行”是一个专业术语，主要用来鼓舞士气。 如果老板告诉我们这是一个正在进行的项目，我们会以更大的热情面对我们的日常工作; 如果机构已经将我们的资金用于正在进行的需求，我们会更愿意给予机构。 否则我们可能成为百分制的牺牲品。

I could go on; I have enough examples to fill a book, but it's not a book I would want anyone to read. We're still left with the question: What is good usage? One helpful approach is to try to separate usage from jargon.

我可以继续讲下去; 我有足够的例子来写一本书，但我不想让任何人读这本书。 我们还有一个问题: 什么是好的用法？ 一个有用的方法是尝试将用法与行话分开。

I would say, for example, that "prioritize" is jargon-a pompous new verb that sounds more important than "rank"­ and that "bottom line" is usage, a metaphor borrowed from the world of bookkeeping that conveys an image we can picture. As every businessman knows, the bottom line is the one that mat­ters. If someone says, "The bottom line is that we just can't work together," we know what he means. I don't much like the phrase, but the bottom line is that it's here to stay.

例如，我会说，“ equitate”是一个术语——一个华而不实的新动词，听起来比“ rank”更重要——而“ bottom line”是用法，一个借自簿记界的隐喻，传达出一个我们可以想象的形象。 每个商人都知道，底线才是最重要的。 如果有人说，“底线是我们不能一起工作，”我们知道他的意思。 我不太喜欢这个短语，但是底线是，它会一直存在。

New usages also arrive with new political events. Just as Viet­nam gave us "escalate," Watergate gave us a whole lexicon of words connoting obstruction and deceit, including "stonewall," "deep-six," "launder," "enemies list" and other "gate"-suffix scandals ("Irangate"). It's a fitting irony that under Richard Nixon "launder" became a dirty word. Today when we hear that someone laundered his funds to hide the origin of the money and the route it took, the word has a precise meaning. It's short, it's vivid, and we need it. I accept "launder" and "stonewall"; I don't accept "prioritize" and "disincentive."

新的用法也伴随着新的政治事件而来。 正如越南让我们“升级”一样，水门事件也给我们提供了一整套词汇，包括“阻碍”、“深六”、“洗钱”、“敌人名单”以及其他“门”后缀丑闻(“伊朗门”)。 具有讽刺意味的是，在理查德•尼克松(Richard Nixon)执政期间，“洗钱”(launder)成了一个肮脏的词汇。 今天，当我们听说有人洗钱来隐藏钱的来源和路线，这个词有一个精确的意思。 它很短，很生动，我们需要它。 我接受“洗钱”和“阻碍” ; 我不接受“优先化”和“抑制”

I would suggest a similar guideline for separating good English from technical English. It's the difference between, say, "printout" and "input." A printout is a specific object that a com­puter emits. Before the advent of computers it wasn't needed; now it is. But it has stayed where it belongs. Not so with "input," which was coined to describe the information that's fed to a computer. Our input is sought on every subject, from diets to philosophical discourse (''I'd like your input on whether God really exists").

我建议用一个类似的指导方针来区分好的英语和技术英语。 这就是“ printout”和“ input”之间的区别 打印输出是计算机发出的特定对象。 在计算机出现之前，人们并不需要它，但现在需要了。 但是它还是留在了它应该呆的地方。 而“输入”则不然，它是用来描述输入计算机的信息的。 从饮食到哲学演讲，每一个主题都需要我们的参与(“我希望你们能参与上帝是否真的存在”)。

I don't want to give somebody my input and get his feedback, though I'd be glad to offer my ideas and hear what he thinks of them. Good usage, to me, consists of using good words if they already exist-as they almost always do-to express myself clearly and simply to someone else. You might say it's how I verbalize the interpersonal.

我不想把我的意见告诉别人，然后得到他的反馈，尽管我很乐意提出我的想法，听听他对这些想法的看法。 好的用法，对我来说，包括使用已经存在的好词——就像它们几乎总是做的那样——向别人清楚而简单地表达自己。 你可能会说这是我表达人际关系的方式。
