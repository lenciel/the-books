There is a kind of writing that might be called journalese, and its the death of freshness in anybody's style. It's the common currency of newspapers and of magazines like People—a mixture of cheap words, made-up words and clichés that have become so pervasive that a writer can hardly help using them. You must fight these phrases or you'll sound like every hack. You'll never make your mark as a writer unless you develop a respect for words and a curiosity about their shades of meaning that is almost obsessive. The English language is rich in strong and supple words. Take the time to root around and find the ones you want.

有一种写作方式可以被称为新闻文体，它使任何人的写作风格失去了新鲜感。这是《人物》等报纸和杂志的通用货币——廉价词汇、虚构词汇和陈词滥调的混合物，已经变得如此普遍，以至于作家几乎无法不使用它们。你必须反对这些短语，否则你会听起来像每个黑客。除非你培养出对文字的尊重和对文字意义的好奇心，否则你永远不会成为一个作家。英语中有许多强而有力的词语。花点时间到处寻找，找到你想要的。

What is "journalese"? It's a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech. Adjectives are used as nouns ("greats," "notables"). Nouns are used as verbs ("to host"), or they are chopped off to form verbs ("enthuse," "emote"), or they are padded to form verbs ("beef up," "put teeth into"). This is a world where eminent people are "famed" and their associates are "staffers," where the future is always "upcoming" and
someone is forever "firing off" a note. Nobody in America has sent a note or a memo or a telegram in years. Famed diplomat Henry Kissinger, who hosted foreign notables to beef up the morale of top State Department staffers, sat down and fired off a lot of notes. Notes that are fired off are always fired in anger and from a sitting position. What the weapon is I've never found out.

什么是「新闻术语」 ？ 它是由其他词汇拼凑而成的即时词汇。形容词用作名词(「大师」、「知名人士」)。名词被用作动词(「to host」) ，或者被切成动词形式(「enthuse」 ，「emote」) ，或者被填充成动词形式(「beef up」 ，「put teeth into」)。在这个世界里，杰出的人物是「著名的」 ，他们的同事是「员工」 ，未来总是「即将到来」 ，有人总是「发射」一个备忘录。美国已经有年没有人发过便条、备忘录或电报了。著名的外交官亨利 · 基辛格，曾经接待过一些外国名人，以鼓舞国务院高级官员的士气，他坐下来发表了大量的演讲。被点燃的笔记总是在愤怒中被点燃，并且是从坐着的姿势点燃的。武器是什么我从来没有发现。

Here's an article from a famed newsmagazine that is hard to match for fatigue:

以下是一篇来自一家著名新闻杂志的文章，很难与疲劳匹敌:

> Last February, Plainclothes Patrolman Frank Serpico knocked at the door of a suspected Brooklyn heroin pusher. When the door opened a crack, Serpico shouldered his way in only to be met by a .22-cal. pistol slug crashing into his face. Somehow he survived, although there are still buzzing fragments in his head, causing dizziness and permanent deafness in his left ear. Almost as painful is the suspicion that he may well have been set up for the shooting by other policemen. For Serpico, 35, has been waging a lonely, four-year war against the routine and endemic corruption that he and others claim is rife in the New York City police department. His efforts are now sending shock waves through the ranks of New York's finest… Though the impact of the commissions upcoming report has yet to be felt, Serpico has little hope that…

The upcoming report has yet to be felt because it's still upcoming, and as for the permanent deafness, it's a little early to tell. And what makes those buzzing fragments buzz? By now only Serpico's head should be buzzing. But apart from these lazinesses of logic, what makes the story so tired is the failure of the writer to reach for anything but the nearest cliché. "Shouldered his way," "only to be met," "crashing into his face," "wag.ing a lonely war," "corruption that is rife," "sending shock waves," "New York's finest"—these dreary phrases constitute writing at its most banal. We know just what to expect. No surprise awaits us in the form of an unusual word, an oblique look. We are in the hands of a hack, and we know it right away. We stop reading.

这份即将发表的报告尚未出炉，因为它还在酝酿之中，它会不会是一个永久性耳聋一样的玩意儿，现在下结论还为时过早。但，是什么让这些嗡嗡作响的碎片嗡嗡作响？ 现在应该只有 Serpico 的头在嗡嗡作响了。但是，除了这些逻辑上的懒惰之外，让这个故事如此乏味的是作者除了陈词滥调之外什么都没有触及。「肩负着他的道路」 ，「只是为了得到满足」 ，「撞在他的脸上」 ，「摇摆着一场孤独的战争」 ，「腐败盛行」 ，「发出冲击波」 ，「纽约最优秀的人」——这些沉闷的短语构成了最平庸的写作。我们知道该期待什么。一个不同寻常的单词，一个拐弯抹角的眼神，等待着我们的不是惊喜。我们读的是破玩意儿，而且我们读上几句就知道了。我们停止阅读。

Don't let yourself get in this position. The only way to avoid it is to care deeply about words. If you find yourself writing that someone recently enjoyed a spell of illness, or that a business has been enjoying a slump, ask yourself how much they enjoyed it. Notice the decisions that other writers make in their choice of words and be finicky about the ones you select from the vast supply. The race in writing is not to the swift but to the original.

不要让自己陷入这种境地。避免这种情况的唯一方法就是深切关注词汇。如果你发现自己写道某人最近患了一段时间的疾病，或者某家公司正在经历一场衰退，问问自己他们有多享受。注意其他作家在选词时所做的决定，并且对你从大量词汇中选择的词要小心谨慎。书写的竞赛不是为了速度，而是为了原创。

Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what has been written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, I'd say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writ.ing / wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it. But cultivate the best models. Don't assume that because an article is in a newspaper or a magazine it must be good. Sloppy editing is common in newspapers, often for lack of time, and writers who use clichés often work for editors who have seen so many clichés that they no longer even recognize them.

养成阅读今天正在写的东西和早期大师们已经写的东西的习惯。写作是通过模仿学来的。如果有人问我是怎么学会写作的，我会说我是通过阅读那些正在写作的男人和女人来学会写作的。但是要选对最好的模特。不要因为一篇文章刊登在报纸或杂志上就认为它一定是好的。草率的编辑在报纸中很常见，通常是因为缺乏时间，而那些使用陈词滥调的作者经常为编辑工作，这些编辑见过太多陈词滥调，他们甚至不再能识别出什么是陈词滥调。

Also get in the habit of using dictionaries. My favorite for handy use is Webster's New World Dictionary, Second College Edition, although, like all word freaks, I own bigger dictionaries that will reward me when I'm on some more specialized search. If you have any doubt of what a word means, look it up. Learn its etymology and notice what curious branches its original root has put forth. See if it has any meanings you didn't know it had. Master the small gradations between words that seem to be synonyms. What's the difference between "cajole," "wheedle," "blandish" and "coax"? Get yourself a dictionary of synonyms.

还要养成使用字典的习惯。我最喜欢的方便使用的词是*韦氏新世界词典*，大学第二版，虽然，像所有的单词爱好者一样，我拥有更大的字典，当我进行更专业的搜索时，这些字典会奖励我。如果你对一个词的意思有任何疑问，就去查一查。了解一下它的词源，注意一下它的原始词根究竟生出了什么奇特的分支。看看它是否有你不知道的含义。掌握似乎是同义词的单词之间的细微差别。"cajole", "wheedle", "blandish" 和 "coax"之间有什么区别？ 为自己准备一本同义词词典。

And don't scorn that bulging grab bag Roget's Thesaurus. It's easy to regard the book as hilarious. Look up "villain," for instance, and you'll be awash in such rascality as only a lexicographer could conjure back from centuries of iniquity, obliquity, depravity, knavery, profligacy, frailty, flagrancy, infamy, immorality, corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding and sin. You'll find ruffians and riffraff, miscreants and malefactors, reprobates and rapscallions, hooligans and hoodlums, scamps and scapegraces, scoundrels and scalawags, Jezebels and jades. You'll find adjectives to fit them all (foul and fiendish, devilish and diabolical), and adverbs and verbs to describe how the wrongdoers do their wrong, and cross-references leading to still other thickets of venality and vice. Still, there's no better friend to have around to nudge the memory than Roget. It saves you the time of rummaging in your brain—that network of overloaded grooves—to find the word that's right on the tip of your tongue, where it doesn't do you any good. The Thesaurus is to the writer what a rhyming dictionary is to the songwriter—a reminder of all the choices—and you should use it with gratitude. If, having found the scalawag and the scapegrace, you want to know how they differ, then go to the dictionary.

不要嘲笑那个鼓鼓囊囊的 Roget's Thesaurus。人们很容易认为这本书滑稽可笑。举例来说，如果你查阅一下「villain」这个词，你就会发现，只有一个词典编纂者才能从几个世纪以来的iniquity, obliquity, depravity, knavery, profligacy, frailty, flagrancy, infamy, immorality, corruption, wickedness, wrongdoing, backsliding  和 sin中抽身回来。你会发现ruffians 和 riffraff, miscreants 和 malefactors, reprobates 和 rapscallions, hooligans 和 hoodlums, scamps 和 scapegraces, scoundrels 和 scalawags, Jezebels 和 jades。你会找到适合它们的形容词(foul 和 fiendish, devilish 和 diabolical) ，以及描述违法者如何做错事的副词和动词，还有交叉引用导致更多的腐败和邪恶。然而，没有比 Roget 更好的朋友来提醒你这段记忆了。这样可以节省你在大脑中搜寻的时间ーー也就是那个超负荷的沟槽网络ーー找到那个就在你舌尖上的词，而那个词对你没有任何好处。同义词词典对于作者来说就像押韵的词典对于词曲作者一样ーー它提醒你所有的选择ーー你应该怀着感激的心情来使用它。如果你找到了 scalawag 和 scapegrace，想知道它们有什么不同，那就去查字典。

Also bear in mind, when you're choosing words and stringing them together, how they sound. This may seem absurd: readers read with their eyes. But in fact they hear what they are reading far more than you realize. Therefore such matters as rhythm and alliteration are vital to every sentence. A typical example— maybe not the best, but undeniably the nearest—is the preceding paragraph. Obviously I enjoyed making a certain arrangement of my ruffians and riffraff, my hooligans and hoodlums, and my readers enjoyed it too—far more than if I had provided a mere list. They enjoyed not only the arrangement but the effort to entertain them. They weren't enjoying it, however, with their eyes. They were hearing the words in their inner ear.

还要记住，当你选词并把它们串在一起的时候，它们听起来怎么样。这可能看起来很荒谬: 读者用他们的眼睛来阅读。但事实上，他们听到的比你意识到的要多得多。因此，节奏和头韵对每个句子都是至关重要的。一个典型的例子 —— 也许不是最好的，但无疑是最接近的 —— 是前面那一段。显然，我很喜欢对我的「ruffians 和 riffraff」、「hooligans 和 hoodlums」这样的编排，我的读者也很喜欢这种编排 —— 远远超过我提供一个单纯的清单。他们不仅喜欢这种编排，而且还喜欢这种娱乐他们的努力。然而，他们的眼睛并不喜欢这种感觉。他们从内耳听到了这些话。

E.B.White makes the case cogently in The Elements of Style, a book every writer should read once a year, when he suggests trying to rearrange any phrase that has survived for a century or two, such as Thomas Paine s "These are the times that try men's souls":

E·b·怀特(e.b.White)在《文体要素》(The Elements of Style)一书中有力地阐述了这一点。这本书每个作家都应该每年读一次，他建议尝试重新编排任何存在了一两个世纪的短语，比如托马斯·潘恩(Thomas Paine)的《这些是考验人们灵魂的时代》：

> Times like these try men's souls.\
> How trying it is to live in these times!\
> These are trying times for men's souls.\
> Soulwise, these are trying times.

Paine s phrase is like poetry and the other four are like oat-meal—which is the divine mystery of the creative process. Good writers of prose must be part poet, always listening to what they write. E. B. White is one of my favorite stylists because I'm conscious of being with a man who cares about the cadences and sonorities of the language. I relish (in my ear) the pattern his words make as they fall into a sentence. I try to surmise how in rewriting the sentence he reassembled it to end with a phrase that will momentarily linger, or how he chose one word over another because he was after a certain emotional weight. It's the difference between, say, "serene" and "tranquil"—one so soft, the other strangely disturbing because of the unusual n and q.

潘恩的短语如诗，其他四句如燕麦片，这是创作过程中的神秘之处。优秀的散文作家必须是半个诗人，总是倾听他们写的东西。怀特是我最喜欢的造型师之一，因为我意识到和一个关心语言的节奏和声音的男人在一起。我喜欢他的话(在我耳边)变成句子时的模式。我试图推测，在重写这个句子时，他是如何重新组合句子，以一个短语结尾的，这个短语会瞬间逗留，或者他是如何选择一个词而不是另一个词，因为他在追求某种情感的重量。这就是「serene」和「tranquil」的区别ーー一个如此柔和，另一个因为不寻常的 n 和 q 而奇怪地令人不安。

Such considerations of sound and rhythm should be woven through everything you write. If all your sentences move at the same plodding gait, which even you recognize as deadly but don't know how to cure, read them aloud. (I write entirely by ear and read everything aloud before letting it go out into the world.) You'll begin to hear where the trouble lies. See if you can gain variety by reversing the order of a sentence, or by substituting a word that has freshness or oddity, or by altering the length of your sentences so they don't all sound as if they came out of the same mold. An occasional short sentence can carry a tremendous punch. It stays in the reader's ear.

这种对声音和节奏的考虑应该贯穿于你写作的每一部分。如果你所有的句子都步履沉重，即使你认为这是致命的，但是不知道如何治愈，大声读出来。(我完全靠听觉写作，在把所有的东西都大声读出来之前，让它们走向世界。) 你会开始听到问题所在。看看你是否可以通过颠倒句子的顺序，或者用新鲜或奇怪的词代替，或者改变句子的长度，使它们听起来不像是来自同一个模子。偶尔的一句简短的话可以带来巨大的冲击。它留在读者的耳朵里。

Remember that words are the only tools you've got. Learn to use them with originality and care. And also remember: somebody out there is listening.

记住，文字是你唯一的工具。学会原创性和谨慎地使用它们。还要记住: 外面有人在倾听。
