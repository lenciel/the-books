A school in Connecticut once held 「a day devoted to the arts, and I was asked if I would come and talk about writing as a vocation. When I arrived I found that a second speaker had been invited-Dr. Brock (as I’ll call him), a surgeon who had recently begun to write and had sold some stories to magazines. He was going to talk about writing as an avocation. That made us a panel, and we sat down to face a crowd of students and teachers and parents, all eager to learn the secrets of our glam­orous work.

康涅狄格州的一所学校曾经举办过一个「艺术节」 ，有人问我是否愿意把写作作为一种职业来谈谈。当我到达时，我发现他们还邀请了另一位演讲者。布洛克(我这么叫他) ，一个外科医生，最近开始写作，并向杂志出售了一些故事。他打算谈论如何将写作作为一个业余爱好。这使我们成为了一个小组，我们坐下来面对一群学生、老师和家长，他们都渴望了解我们迷人工作的秘密。

Dr. Brock was dressed in a bright red jacket, looking vaguely bohemian, as authors are supposed to look, and the first ques­tion went to him. What was it like to be a writer?

布洛克博士穿着一件鲜红色的夹克，看起来有点像波西米亚人，这是作家们看起来应该是的样子。人们的第一个问题是问他的：「当作家是什么感觉？」

He said it was tremendous fun. Coming home from an ardu­ous day at the hospital, he would go straight to his yellow pad and write his tensions away. The words just flowed. It was easy. I then said that writing wasn’t easy and wasn’t fun. It was hard and lonely, and the words seldom just flowed.

他说这非常有趣。在医院度过了忙碌而艰辛的一天回到家里，他会径直走到他的黄色便笺簿前，通过写作让自己的紧张情绪消失。那些字就这么流动出来了。就是如此简单。然后我说写作并不容易，也不好玩。这是艰难和孤独的，而且那些字也很少就那样流出来。

Next Dr. Brock was asked if it was important to rewrite.

接下来有人问布洛克医生是否重写非常重要。

Absolutely not, he said. 「Let it all hang out,」 he told us, and whatever form the sentences take will reflect the writer at his most natural. I then said that rewriting is the essence of writing. I pointed out that professional writers rewrite their sentences over and over and then rewrite what they have rewritten.

绝对不行，他说。他告诉我们: 「把所有的东西都挂起来」，不管句子采用什么形式，都会反映出作者最自然的一面。然后我说重写是写作的本质。我指出，专业作家一遍又一遍地重写他们的东西，然后再重写他们重写出的东西。

「What do you do on days when it isn’t going well?」 Dr. Brock was asked. He said he just stopped writing and put the work aside for a day when it would go better. I then said that the pro­fessional writer must establish a daily schedule and stick to it. I said that writing is a craft, not an art, and that the man who runs away from his craft because he lacks inspiration is fooling him­ self. He is also going broke.

「当事情不顺利的时候，你会怎么做？」 布洛克医生被问到。他说，他会停止写作，把作品放在一边，等一天事情就会好起来。然后我说，职业作家必须建立一个日程表，并坚持下去。我说过，写作是一门手艺，而不是一门艺术，那些因为缺乏灵感而放弃写作的人是在自欺欺人。他们也会很快就写不出东西。

「What if you’re feeling depressed or unhappy?」 a student asked. 「Won’t that affect your writing?」

「如果你感到沮丧或不开心怎么办？」 一个学生问道。「这不会影响你的写作吗？」

Probably it will, Dr. Brock replied. Go fishing. Take a walk. Probably it won’t, I said. If your job is to write every day, you learn to do it like any other job.

可能会的，布洛克医生回答道。去钓鱼。出去走走。也许不会，我说。如果你的工作是每天写作，那么你就要学会像其他工作一样去做。

A student asked if we found it useful to circulate in the liter­ary world. Dr. Brock said he was greatly enjoying his new life as a man of letters, and he told several stories of being taken to lunch by his publisher and his agent at Manhattan restaurants where writers and editors gather. I said that professional writers are solitary drudges who seldom see other writers.

一个学生问我们是否觉得混圈子在文学界有用。布洛克说，他非常享受作为一个文人的新生活，他还讲了几个故事，说自己的出版商和经纪人带他去曼哈顿餐厅吃午饭，那里有作家和编辑聚会。我说过，职业作家是孤独的苦工，他们很少见到其他作家。

「Do you put symbolism in your writing?」 a student asked me. 「Not if I can help it,」 I replied. I have an unbroken record of missing the deeper meaning in any story, play or movie, and as for dance and mime, I have never had any idea of what is being conveyed.

「你的作品中有象征主义吗？」 一个学生问我。「如果我能忍住的话，就不会。」我回答。我有一个大概没人可以打破的记录，那就是在任何故事、戏剧或电影中都会漏掉里面包含的那些所谓更深层的含义，至于舞蹈和哑剧，我从来不知道它们在传达什么。

「I love symbols!」 Dr. Brock exclaimed, and he described with gusto the joys of weaving them through his work.

「我喜欢象征! 」 布洛克博士大声说道，并津津有味地描述了在他的作品中编织它们的乐趣。

So the morning went, and it was a revelation to all of us. At the end Dr. Brock told me he was enormously interested in my answers-it had never occurred to him that writing could be hard. I told him I was just as interested in his answers-it had never occurred to me that writing could be easy. Maybe I should take up surgery on the side.

这个早晨就过去了，发生的对话对我们所有人来说都充满了启示。最后，布罗克博士告诉我，他对我的答案非常感兴趣——他从来没有想到写作会很难。我告诉他，我对他的答案也同样感兴趣——我从来没有想到写作会如此简单。也许我应该兼职做外科手术。

As for the students, anyone might think we left them bewil­dered. But in fact we gave them a broader glimpse of the writ­ing process than if only one of us had talked. For there isn’t any 「right」 way to do such personal work. There are all kinds of writers and all kinds of methods, and any method that helps you to say what you want to say is the right method for you. Some people write by day, others by night. Some people need silence, others tum on the radio. Some write by hand, some by word processor, some by talking into a tape recorder. Some people write their first draft in one long burst and then revise; others can’t write the second paragraph until they have fiddled end­lessly with the first.

至于那些学生，任何人都会认为我们让他们感到困惑。但事实上，相比只有我们中任何人的一面之词，我们让他们有机会对写作过程有了一个更广泛了解。因为没有任何「正确」的方式来做写作这样个人化的工作。有各种各样的作家和各种各样的方法，**任何能帮助你说出你想说的话的方法都是适合你的**。有些人白天写作，有些人晚上写作。有些人需要安静，有些人需要打开收音机。有些人用手写，有些人用文字编辑器，有些人用录音机录音。有些人的第一篇草稿会先完成整个故事的梗概，然后再去修改和润色细节; 有些人没完没了地摆弄第一段，在满意之前他们没法写出下一段。

But all of them are vulnerable and all of them are tense. They are driven by a compulsion to put some part of themselves on paper, and yet they don’t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the person who sat down to write. The problem is to find the real man or woman behind the tension.

但是他们都很脆弱，他们也都很紧张。他们被一种把自己的一部分写在纸上的冲动所驱使，然而他们并不只是写出自然而然的东西。他们坐下来进行文学创作，在纸上浮现的那个自我比坐下来写作的人要难对付得多。真正的难题在于找到并披露出紧张背后那个男人或女人真正的风貌。

Ultimately the product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is. I often find myself reading with interest about a topic I never thought would interest me-some scientific quest, perhaps. What holds me is the enthusiasm of the writer for his field. How was he drawn into it？What emotional baggage did he bring along？How did it change his life？It’s not necessary to want to spend a year alone at Walden Pond to become involved with a writer who did.

归根结底，任何作家都不得不推销的产品不是被写的主题，而是他或她是谁。我发现自己经常饶有兴趣地阅读一个我从未想过会引起我兴趣的话题——也许是某种科学探索。使我坚持下来的是这位作家对他所在领域的热情。他是怎么卷进来的？他带着什么感情包袱？这对他的生活有什么影响？读书的妙处在于，你没有必要自己花一年的时间独自在瓦尔登湖居住，就可以与一个干过这事的作家进行交流。

This is the personal transaction that’s at the heart of good nonfiction writing. Out of it come two of the most important qualities that this book will go in search of: humanity and warmth. Good writing has an aliveness that keeps the reader reading from one paragraph to the next, and it’s not a question of gimmicks to 「personalize」 the author. It’s a question of using the English language in a way that will achieve the greatest clar­ity and strength.

这是私人交易，是好的非虚构写作的核心。由此产生了本书将要探索的两个最重要的品质: 人性和温暖。好的写作有一种活力，驱使读者从一个段落读到下一个段落，靠得不是作者所谓「个性化」风格的花招。靠得是以正确的方式使用英语，从而达到最好的清晰度和强度。

Can such principles be taught？Maybe not. But most of them can be learned.

这样的原则可以被教授吗？也许不能。但是它们中的大多数是可以学习的。
