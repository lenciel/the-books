Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.

杂乱是美国文学的疾病。我们是一个充斥着不必要的词汇、循环结构、浮夸的修饰和无意义的行话的社会。

Who can understand the clotted language of everyday American commerce: the memo, the corporation report, the business letter, the notice from the bank explaining its latest 「simplified」 statement？What member of an insurance or medical plan can decipher the brochure explaining his costs and benefits？What father or mother can put together a child’s toy from the instructions on the box？Our national tendency is to inflate and thereby sound important. The airline pilot who announces that he is presently anticipating experiencing considerable precipitation wouldn’t think of saying it may rain. The sentence is too simple—there must be something wrong with it.

谁能理解美国日常商业中凝结的语言: 备忘录、公司报告、商业信函、银行发布的它最新的「简化的」声明？保险公司或医疗保险公司的哪位成员能够看懂解释其成本和收益的小册子？有哪位父母可以根据说明毫不费劲地把孩子的玩具拼起来？我们的国家倾向于通货膨胀，因此这样做好像具有无可避免的重要性。航空公司的飞行员宣布，他目前正在经历相当大的降水过程，而不是就简单说「下雨」。这个句子太简单了 ーー 一定是出了什么问题。

But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that’s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what— these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank.

但是，优秀写作的秘诀在于把每一句话去掉直到只剩最干净的部分。每一个没有功能的单词，每一个本可以是短词的长词，每一个带有与动词相同意义的副词，每一个让读者不确定是谁在做什么的被动结构，这些都是削弱句子强度的数不清的「掺假词」。它们通常与教育程度和管理层级成正比。

During the 1960s the president of my university wrote a letter to mollify the alumni after a spell of campus unrest. 「You are probably aware,」 he began, 「that we have been experiencing very considerable potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction on issues only partially related.」 He meant that the students had been hassling them about different things. I was far more upset by the president s English than by the students’ potentially explosive expressions of dissatisfaction. I would have preferred the presidential approach taken by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he tried to convert into English his own governments memos, such as this blackout order of 1942:

在20世纪60年代，我们大学的校长写了一封信来安抚一段时间的校园骚乱后的校友们。「你可能已经意识到，」他开始说，「我们已经经历了相当多部分相关的潜在的爆炸性表达不满的事件」 他的意思是，学生们一直在为不同的事情争吵不休。比起学生们潜在的爆发性的不满表达，我对校长的英语更加不满。我更倾向于采用富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福·奥巴马总统的做法，他试图将自己政府的备忘录转换成英文，比如 1942 年的禁止通行令:

> Such preparations shall be made as will completely obscure all Federal buildings and non-Federal buildings occupied by the Federal government during an air raid for any period of time from visibility by reason of internal or external illumination.

> 在进行这种准备时，由于内部或外部照明的原因，联邦政府在空袭期间占据的所有联邦建筑物和非联邦建筑物在任何时间内都将完全隐蔽。

「Tell them,」 Roosevelt said, 「that in buildings where they have to keep the work going to put something across the windows.」

「告诉他们，」罗斯福说，「在那些需要保持工作量的建筑物里，应该在窗户上贴些东西。」

Simplify, simplify. Thoreau said it, as we are so often reminded, and no American writer more consistently practiced what he preached. Open Walden to any page and you will find a man saying in a plain and orderly way what is on his mind:

简化，简化。正如我们经常被提醒的那样，梭罗是这么说的，没有哪个美国作家比他更坚持不懈地践行他所鼓吹的东西。打开瓦尔登湖的任何一页，你都会发现一个人用一种简单而有条理的方式说出他的心事:

> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

我到树林里去是因为我希望刻意地生活，只面对生活的基本事实，看看我是否能学到它必须教给我的东西，而不是当我死去时，掩盖我没有活过的事实。

How can the rest of us achieve such enviable freedom from clutter？The answer is to clear our heads of clutter. Clear think.ing becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other. It’s impossible for a muddy thinker to write good English. He may get away with it for a paragraph or two, but soon the reader will be lost, and there’s no sin so grave, for the reader will not easily be lured back.

我们其他人是如何从杂乱中获得这种令人羡慕的自由的呢？答案就是清除我们头脑中的杂乱。清晰的思考变成了清晰的写作; 一个不能没有另一个。一个思想混乱的人不可能写出好的英语。他也许能逃脱一两段，但是很快读者就会迷失，没有什么罪恶会如此严重，因为读者不会轻易被引诱回来。

Who is this elusive creature, the reader？The reader is someone with an attention span of about 30 seconds—a person assailed by many forces competing for attention. At one time those forces were relatively few: newspapers, magazines, radio, spouse, children, pets. Today they also include a 「home entertainment center」 (television, VCR, tapes, CDs), e-mail, the Internet, the cellular phone, the fax machine, a fitness program, a pool, a lawn, and that most potent of competitors, sleep. The man or woman snoozing in a chair with a magazine or a book is a person who was being given too much unnecessary trouble by the writer.

读者这个难以捉摸的生物，究竟是谁？读者是一个注意力持续时间大约为30秒的人 ーー 为了获得他们的注意力，多种力量攻击都在尝试攻陷他们。曾几何时，这些力量相对较少: 报纸、杂志、广播、配偶、孩子、宠物。如今，它们还包括一个「家庭娱乐中心」(电视、录像机、磁带、 cd)、电子邮件、互联网、手机、传真机、健身计划、游泳池、草坪，以及最强大的竞争对手——睡觉。坐在椅子上看杂志或书的男人或女人是被作者给了太多不必要麻烦的人。

It won’t do to say that the reader is too dumb or too lazy to keep pace with the train of thought. If the reader is lost, it’s usually because the writer hasn’t been careful enough. That carelessness can take any number of forms. Perhaps a sentence is so excessively cluttered that the reader, hacking through the verbiage, simply doesn’t know what it means. Perhaps a sentence has been so shoddily constructed that the reader could read it in several ways. Perhaps the writer has switched pronouns in mid-sentence, or has switched tenses, so the reader loses track of who is talking or when the action took place. Perhaps Sentence B is not a logical sequel to Sentence A; the writer, in whose head the connection is clear, hasn’t bothered to provide the missing link. Perhaps the writer has used a word incorrectly by not taking the trouble to look it up. He or she may think 「sanguine」 and 「sanguinary」 mean the same thing, but the difference is a bloody big one. The reader can only infer (speaking of big differences) what the writer is trying to imply.

说读者太笨或太懒以至于跟不上思路是不合适的。如果读者迷失了方向，那通常是因为作者不够细心。这种粗心大意可以表现为任何形式。也许一个句子是如此地杂乱，以至于读者在翻阅这些冗长的句子时，根本不知道它的意思。也许一个句子被粗制滥造，读者可以通过几种方式来阅读它。也许作者在句子中间改变了代词，或者改变了时态，这样读者就会忘记谁在说话，或者什么时候发生了什么动作。也许 b 句不是 a 句的合乎逻辑的续篇; 在作者的脑海中，连接是清晰的，没有费心提供缺失的环节。也许作者没有不辞辛苦地查找，使用了一个不正确的词。他或她可能认为「sanguine」和「sanguiary」是同一个意思，但区别是非常大的。读者只能推断(说到巨大的差异)作者试图暗示什么。

Two pages of the final manuscript of this chapter from the First Edition of On Writing Well. Although they look like a first draft, they had already been rewritten and retyped—like almost every other page— four or five times. With each rewrite I try to make what I have written tighter, stronger and more precise, eliminating every element that’s not doing useful work. Then I go over it once more, reading it aloud, and am always amazed at how much clutter can still be cut. (In later editions I eliminated the sexist pronoun 「he」 denoting 「the writer」 and 「the reader.」)

本章最后手稿两页，摘自《论写作》第一版。尽管它们看起来像是初稿，但它们已经被重写和打印了四五次——几乎每一页都是如此。每次重写，我都试图使我写的东西更紧凑、更有力、更精确，剔除所有不起作用的元素。然后我又看了一遍，大声地读了一遍，总是惊奇地发现还有那么多杂乱的东西可以被剪掉。(在以后的版本中，我删除了性别歧视代词「他」 ，而是使用「作者」和「读者」。)

Faced with such obstacles, readers are at first tenacious. They blame themselves—they obviously missed something, and they go back over the mystifying sentence, or over the whole paragraph, piecing it out like an ancient rune, making guesses and moving on. But they won’t do that for long. The writer is making them work too hard, and they will look for one who is better at the craft.

面对这样的障碍，读者起初是很顽强的。他们责怪自己ーー很明显他们漏掉了什么，然后他们回过头来看那个神秘的句子，或者整个段落，像古代符文一样拼凑出来，猜测然后继续前进。但他们不会长期这样做。作者如果让他们读得太辛苦了，他们会寻找一个更擅长写作这门手艺的人。

Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say？Surprisingly often they don’t know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask: have I said it？Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time？If it’s not, some fuzz has worked its way into the machinery. The clear writer is someone clearheaded enough to see this stuff for what it is: fuzz.

因此，作家必须不断地问: 我想说什么？令人惊讶的是，他们常常不知道。然后他们必须看看他们写的东西，问: 我说过吗？对于第一次遇到这个问题的人来说，这是清楚的吗？如果不是这样，一些模糊的东西已经进入了机器。清晰的作者是那些头脑足够清醒的人，他们能看到这些东西的本质: 模糊。

I don’t mean that some people are born clearheaded and are therefore natural writers, whereas others are naturally fuzzy and will never write well. Thinking clearly is a conscious act that writers must force on themselves, as if they were working on any other project that requires logic: making a shopping list or doing an algebra problem. Good writing doesn’t come naturally, though most people seem to think it does. Professional writers are constantly bearded by people who say they’d like to 「try a little writing sometime」—meaning when they retire from their real profession, like insurance or real estate, which is hard. Or they say, 「I could write a book about that.」 I doubt it.

我的意思不是说有些人天生头脑清醒，因此是天生的作家，而有些人天生模糊，永远写不好。清晰地思考是作者必须强加给自己的一种有意识的行为，就好像他们正在做任何其他需要逻辑的项目: 列购物清单或者做一道代数题。好的写作并不是天生的，尽管大多数人认为它是自然而然的。专业作家经常被那些说他们也可以「尝试一下写作」的人们挑战 ーー 他们觉得自己从保险或房地产等真正的职业退休后就可以随时自己写一本，其实没这么容易。或者他们说，「我可以写一本关于这个的书」。我对此表示怀疑。

Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it’s because it is hard.

写作是一项艰苦的工作。一个清晰的句子绝非偶然。很少有句子在第一次，甚至第三次出现时是正确的。在绝望的时刻记住这一点。如果你发现写作很难，那是因为它很难。
