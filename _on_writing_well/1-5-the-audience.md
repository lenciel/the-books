Soon after you confront the matter of preserving your identity, another question will occur to you: "Who am I writing for?"

在你解决了如何通过风格来构建自己文字的独特性之后，另一个问题会出现在你面前: 「我在为谁写作? 」

It s a fundamental question, and it has a fundamental answer: You are writing for yourself. Don't try to visualize the great mass audience. There is no such audience—every reader is a differ.ent person. Don't try to guess what sort of thing editors want to publish or what you think the country is in a mood to read. Editors and readers don't know what they want to read until they read it. Besides, they're always looking for something new.

这是一个基本的问题，它有一个基本的答案: 你是在为自己写作。不要试图想象那些伟大的大众观众。没有这样的读者ーー每个读者都是不同的人。不要试图去猜测编辑想要发表什么样的东西，或者你认为这个国家有什么样的心情去阅读。编辑和读者在阅读之前并不知道他们想读什么。此外，他们总是在寻找新的东西。

Don't worry about whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge a sudden impulse for humor. If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in. (It can always be taken out, but only you can put it in.) You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for. If you lose the dullards back in the dust, you don't want them anyway.

不要担心如果你突然有了幽默的冲动，读者是否会「明白」。如果它在写作的过程中使你感到愉快，那就把它放进去。(它总是可以拿出来，但只有你可以把它放进去。) 你写作主要是为了取悦自己，如果你带着乐趣写作，你也会娱乐那些值得为之写作的读者。如果你失去了那些愚蠢的人，你也不会想要他们的。

This may seem to be a paradox. Earlier I warned that the reader is an impatient bird, perched on the thin edge of distraction or sleep. Now I'm saying you must write for yourself and not be gnawed by worry over whether the reader is tagging along.

这似乎是一个悖论。早些时候我警告说，读者是一只不耐烦的鸟，栖息在分心或睡眠的边缘。现在我要说的是，你必须为自己写作，而不是担心读者是否会跟随你。

I'm talking about two different issues. One is craft, the other is attitude. The first is a question of mastering a precise skill. The second is a question of how you use that skill to express your personality.

我说的是两个不同的问题。一个是技巧，另一个是态度。第一个问题是掌握一项精确的技能。第二个问题是你如何使用这种技能来表达你的个性。

In terms of craft, there's no excuse for losing readers through sloppy workmanship. If they doze off in the middle of your article because you have been careless about a technical detail, the fault is yours. But on the larger issue of whether the reader likes you, or likes what you are saying or how you are saying it, or agrees with it, or feels an affinity for your sense of humor or your vision of life, don't give him a moment's worry. You are who you are, he is who he is, and either you'll get along or you won't.

就技术而言，没有理由因为粗糙的工艺而失去读者。如果他们在你的文章中间打瞌睡，是因为你对技术细节不够重视，那么错误就是你的。但是更大的问题是，读者是否喜欢你，或者喜欢你说的话或者你说的方式，或者同意你说的话，或者对你的幽默感或者你对生活的看法感到亲近，不要给他片刻的担心。你就是你，他就是他，你要么和他相处，要么不和他相处。

Perhaps this still seems like a paradox. How can you think carefully about not losing the reader and still be carefree about his opinion? I assure you that they are separate processes.

也许这看起来仍然像是一个悖论。你怎么能在不失去读者的同时还能对他的观点无忧无虑呢？ 我向你保证，它们是分开的过程。

First, work hard to master the tools. Simplify, prune and strive for order. Think of this as a mechanical act, and soon your sentences will become cleaner. The act will never become as mechanical as, say, shaving or shampooing—you will always have to think about the various ways in which the tools can be used. But at least your sentences will be grounded in solid principles, and your chances of losing the reader will be smaller.

首先，努力掌握工具。简化，修剪，争取秩序。把这想象成一个机械的动作，很快你的句子就会变得干净利落。这种行为永远不会变得像剃须或洗头那样机械化ーー你将永远不得不考虑使用这些工具的各种方式。但是至少你的句子会有坚实的原则基础，你失去读者的几率也会小一些。

Think of the other as a creative act: the expressing of who you are. Relax and say what you want to say. And since style is who you are, you only need to be true to yourself to find it gradually emerging from under the accumulated clutter and debris, growing more distinctive every day. Perhaps the style won't solidify for years as your style, your voice. Just as it takes time to find yourself as a person, it takes time to find yourself as a stylist, and even then your style will change as you grow older.

把对方想象成一种创造性的行为: 表达你是谁。放松，想说什么就说什么。因为风格就是你，你只需要真实的面对自己，就会发现它逐渐从堆积的杂物和碎片中显现出来，每天都变得越来越与众不同。也许这种风格在未来几年内不会成为你的风格，你的声音。就像发现自己是一个人需要时间一样，发现自己是一个造型师也需要时间，即使这样，你的风格也会随着年龄的增长而改变。

But whatever your age, be yourself when you write. Many old men still write with the zest they had in their twenties or thirties; obviously their ideas are still young. Other old writers ramble and repeat themselves; their style is the tip-off that they have turned into garrulous bores. Many college students write as if they were desiccated alumni 30 years out. Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't comfortably say in conversation. If you're not a person who says "indeed" or "moreover," or who calls someone an individual ("he's a fine individual"), please don't write it.

但是无论你年龄多大，当你写作的时候，做你自己。许多老年人仍然带着二三十岁时的热情写作; 显然他们的思想仍然年轻。其他的老作家不断地重复他们自己，他们的风格是他们已经变成喋喋不休的无聊透顶的小道消息。许多大学生写作时就好像他们是30年后的枯燥校友。永远不要用书面形式说任何你在谈话中不舒服的话。如果你不是一个说「确实」或「此外」的人，或者说某人是一个人(「他是一个好人」) ，请不要写它。

Let's look at a few writers to see the pleasure with which they put on paper their passions and their crotchets, not caring whether the reader shares them or not. The first excerpt is from "The Hen (An Appreciation)," written by E. B. White in 1944, at the height of World War II:

让我们来看看一些作家，看看他们把自己的激情和怪癖写在纸上的乐趣，不管读者是否分享他们。第一段摘录自 e·b·怀特(e.b.White)1944年写的《母鸡(一种欣赏)》(The Hen (An Appreciation)) ，当时正值二战高潮:

> Chickens do not always enjoy an honorable position among city-bred people, although the egg, I notice, goes on and on. Right now the hen is in favor. The war has deified her and she is the darling of the home front, feted at conference tables, praised in every smoking car, her girlish ways and curious habits the topic of many an excited husbandryman to whom yesterday she was a stranger without honor or allure.
> 
> My own attachment to the hen dates from 1907, and I have been faithful to her in good times and bad. Ours has not always been an easy relationship to maintain. At first, as a boy in a carefully zoned suburb, I had neighbors and police to reckon with; my chickens had to be as closely guarded as an underground newspaper. Later, as a man in the country, I had my old friends in town to reckon with, most of whom regarded the hen as a comic prop straight out of vaudeville...Their scorn only increased my devotion to the hen. I remained loyal, as a man would to a bride whom his family received with open ridicule. Now it is my turn to wear the smile, as I listen to the enthusiastic cackling of urbanites, who have suddenly taken up the hen socially and who fill the air with their newfound ecstasy and knowledge and the relative charms of the New Hampshire Red and the Laced Wyandotte. You would think, from their nervous cries of wonder and praise, that the hen was hatched yesterday in the suburbs of New York, instead of in the remote past in the jungles of India.
> 
> To a man who keeps hens, all poultry lore is exciting and endlessly fascinating. Every spring I settle down with my farm journal and read, with the same glazed expression on my face, the age-old story of how to prepare a brooder house...

There's a man writing about a subject I have absolutely no interest in. Yet I enjoy this piece thoroughly. I like the simple beauty of its style. I like the rhythms, the unexpected but refreshing words ("deified", "allure", "cackling"), the specific details like the Laced Wyandotte and the brooder house. But mainly what I like is that this is a man telling me unabashedly about a love affair with poultry that goes back to 1907. It's written with humanity and warmth, and after three paragraphs I know quite a lot about what sort of man this hen-lover is.

这个人在写一个我完全不感兴趣的主题。然而，我非常喜欢这篇作品。我喜欢它简单美丽的风格。我喜欢它的节奏，那些出人意料却又令人耳目一新的词汇("deified", "allure", "cackling") ，还有一些具体的细节，比如 Laced Wyandotte 和布鲁德的房子。但我最喜欢的是，这个男人毫不掩饰地告诉我，自1907年以来，他对家禽的热爱。这本书充满了人性和温暖，写了三段之后，我对这个爱鸡的男人有了相当多的了解。

Or take a writer who is almost White s opposite in terms of style, who relishes the opulent word for its opulence and doesn't deify the simple sentence. Yet they are brothers in holding firm opinions and saying what they think. This is H. L. Mencken reporting on the notorious "Monkey Trial"—the trial of John Scopes, a young teacher who taught the theory of evolution in his Tennessee classroom—in the summer of 1925:

或者拿一个在风格上几乎与怀特截然相反的作家来说，他喜欢华丽这个词，因为它富丽堂皇，而不崇拜简单的句子。然而，他们是兄弟，坚持自己的观点，说出自己的想法。这是 h·l·门肯(h. l. Mencken)对臭名昭著的「猴子审判」(Monkey Trial)的报道 —— 1925年夏天，约翰 · 斯科普斯(John Scopes)在田纳西州的课堂上讲授进化论:

> It was hot weather when they tried the infidel Scopes at Dayton, Tenn., but I went down there very willingly, for I was eager to see something of evangelical Christianity as a going concern. In the big cities of the Republic, despite the endless efforts of consecrated men, it is laid up with a wasting disease. The very Sunday-school superintendents, taking jazz from the stealthy radio, shake their fire-proof legs; their pupils, moving into adolescence, no longer respond to the proliferating hormones by enlisting for missionary service in Africa, but resort to necking instead. Even in Dayton, I found, though the mob was up to do execution on Scopes, there was a strong smell of antinomianism. The nine churches of the village were all half empty on Sunday, and weeds choked their yards. Only two or three of the resident pastors managed to sustain themselves by their ghostly science; the rest had to take orders for mail-order pantaloons or work in the adjacent strawberry fields; one, I heard, was a barber…Exactly twelve minutes after I reached the village I was taken in tow by a Christian man and introduced to the favorite tipple of the Cumberland Range; half corn liquor and half Coca-Cola. It seemed a dreadful dose to me, but I found that the Dayton illuminati got it down with gusto, rubbing their tummies and rolling their eyes. They were all hot for Genesis, but their faces were too florid to belong to teetotalers, and when a pretty girl came tripping down the main street, they reached for the places where their neckties should have been with all the amorous enterprise of movie stars…

This is pure Mencken in its surging momentum and its irreverence. At almost any page where you open his books he is saying something sure to outrage the professed pieties of his countrymen. The sanctity in which Americans bathed their heroes, their churches and their edifying laws—especially Prohibition—was a well of hypocrisy for him that never dried up. Some of his heaviest ammunition he hurled at politicians and Presidents—his portrait of "The Archangel Woodrow" still scorches the pages—and as for Christian believers and clerical folk, they turn up unfailingly as mountebanks and boobs.

这是纯粹的门肯在其汹涌的势头和不敬。几乎在你翻开他的书的任何一页，他所说的话肯定会激怒自称虔诚的国民。美国人为他们的英雄、他们的教堂和他们有益的法律 —— 尤其是禁酒令 —— 洗礼的圣洁，对他来说是一口永不干涸的伪善之井。他向政治家和总统发出了一些最有力的抨击 —— 他对《天使长伍德罗》(The Archangel Woodrow)的描写至今仍让报纸大跌眼镜——而对于基督教信徒和牧师来说，他们无一例外地变成了江湖骗子和笨蛋。

It may seem a miracle that Mencken could get away with such heresies in the 1920s, when hero worship was an American religion and the self-righteous wrath of the Bible Belt oozed from coast to coast. Not only did he get away with it; he was the most revered and influential journalist of his generation. The impact he made on subsequent writers of nonfiction is beyond measuring, and even now his topical pieces seem as fresh as if they were written yesterday.

在20世纪20年代，当英雄崇拜成为美国的一种宗教，圣经地带的自以为是的愤怒从东海岸渗透到西海岸的时候，门肯能够逃脱这样的异端邪说似乎是一个奇迹。他不仅逃脱了惩罚，而且是他那一代人中最受尊敬和最有影响力的记者。他对后来的非小说作家的影响是无法估量的，即使是现在，他的专题作品看起来还像是昨天写的一样新鲜。

The secret of his popularity—aside from his pyrotechnical use of the American language—was that he was writing for himself and didn't give a damn what the reader might think. It was.n't necessary to share his prejudices to enjoy seeing them expressed with such mirthful abandon. Mencken was never timid or evasive; tie didn't kowtow to the reader or curry any-one's favor. It takes courage to be such a writer, but it is out of such courage that revered and influential journalists are born.

他受欢迎的秘密ーー除了他对美国语言的精妙运用ーー是他在为自己写作，而不在乎读者会怎么想。没有必要分享他的偏见，享受看到这些偏见被如此欣喜地表达出来。门肯从不怯懦或逃避，领带不向读者卑躬屈膝，也不讨好任何人。成为这样的作家需要勇气，但正是这种勇气造就了受人尊敬和有影响力的记者。

Moving forward to our own time, here's an excerpt from How to Survive in Your Native Land, & book by James Herndon describing his experiences as a teacher in a California junior high school. Of all the earnest books on education that have sprouted in America, Herndon s is—for me—the one that best captures how it really is in the classroom. His style is not quite like anybody else's, but his voice is true. Here's how the book starts:

让我们回到我们的时代，这里有一段如何在你的祖国生存的摘录，以及 James Herndon 在书中描述了他在加利福尼亚的一个初级中学教书的经历。在美国涌现出的所有关于教育的严肃著作中，赫恩登的书是ーー在我看来ーー最能抓住课堂教学的真实情况。他的风格与众不同，但他的声音是真实的。这本书是这样开始的:

> I might as well begin with Piston. Piston was, as a matter of description, a red-headed medium-sized chubby eighth-grader; his definitive characteristic was, however, stubborn.ness. Without going into a lot of detail, it became clear right away that what Piston didn't want to do, Piston didn't do; what Piston wanted to do, Piston did.
> 
> It really wasn't much of a problem. Piston wanted mainly to paint, draw monsters, scratch designs on mimeograph blanks and print them up, write an occasional horror story— some kids referred to him as The Ghoul—and when he didn't want to do any of those, he wanted to roam the halls and on occasion (we heard) investigate the girls' bathrooms.
> 
> We had minor confrontations. Once I wanted everyone to sit down and listen to what I had to say—something about the way they had been acting in the halls. I was letting them come and go freely and it was up to them (I planned to point out) not to raise hell so that I had to hear about it from other teachers. Sitting down was the issue—I was determined everyone was going to do it first, then I'd talk. Piston remained standing. I reordered. He paid no attention. I pointed out that I was talking to him. He indicated he heard me. I inquired then why in hell didn't he sit down. He said he didn't want to. I said I did want him to. He said that didn't matter to him. I said do it anyway. He said why? I said because I said so. He said he wouldn't. I said Look I want you to sit down and listen to what I'm going to say. He said he was listening. I'll listen but I won't sit down.
> 
> Well, that's the way it goes sometimes in schools. You as teacher become obsessed with an issue—I was the injured party, conferring, as usual, unheard-of freedoms, and here they were as usual taking advantage. It ain't pleasant coming in the teachers' room for coffee and having to hear somebody say that so-and-so and so-and-so from your class were out in the halls without a pass and making faces and giving the finger to kids in my class during the most important part of my lesson about Egypt—and you ought to be allowed your tendentious speech, and most everyone will allow it, sit down for it, but occasionally someone wises you up by refusing to submit where it isn't necessary…How did any of us get into this? we ought to be asking ourselves.

Any writer who uses "ain't" and "tendentious" in the same sentence, who quotes without using quotation marks, knows what he's doing. This seemingly artless style, so full of art, is ideal for Herndon's purpose. It avoids the pretentiousness that infects so much writing by people who are doing worthy work, and it allows for a rich vein of humor and common sense. Hern.don sounds like a good teacher and a man whose company I would enjoy. But ultimately he is writing for himself: an audience of one.

任何一个在同一句话中使用「 ain’t」和「 tendition」的作家，如果没有使用引号，那么他就知道自己在做什么。这种看似朴素的风格，充满了艺术气息，是赫恩登的理想作品。它避免了那些从事有价值的工作的人所感染的那种自命不凡的写作风格，并且提供了一种富有幽默感和常识的风格。Don 听起来像是一个好老师，一个我喜欢有他陪伴的人。但最终他是在为自己写作: 一个读者。

"Who am I writing for?" The question that begins this chapter has irked some readers. They want me to say "Whom am I writing for?" But I can't bring myself to say it. It’s just not me.

「我在为谁写作? 」 这一章开头的问题激怒了一些读者。他们想让我说「我在为谁写作? 」 但是我不能说出来。这不是我的风格。
