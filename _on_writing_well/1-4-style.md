So much for early warnings about the bloated monsters that lie in ambush for the writer trying to put together a clean English sentence.

前面几章做了大量的警告，关于臃肿的怪物如何伏击那些试图把一个干净的英语句子写出来的作者。

"But," you may say, "if I eliminate everything you think is clutter and if I strip every sentence to its barest bones, will there be anything left of me?" The question is a fair one; simplicity carried to an extreme might seem to point to a style little more sophisticated than "Dick likes Jane" and "See Spot run."

「但是，」你可能会说，「如果我把你认为杂乱无章的东西都清除掉，如果我把每一句话都剥去骨髓，我还会剩下什么吗? 」 这是一个合理的问题; 简单到了极致似乎指向了一种比「 Dick 喜欢Jane 」和「看 Spot 跑步」稍微复杂一点的风格

I'll answer the question first on the level of carpentry. Then I'll get to the larger issue of who the writer is and how to preserve his or her identity.

我先从木工的水平来回答这个问题。然后我会谈到更大的问题，作者是谁，以及如何保持他或她的身份。

Few people realize how badly they write. Nobody has shown them how much excess or murkiness has crept into their style and how it obstructs what they are trying to say. If you give me an eight-page article and I tell you to cut it to four pages, you'll howl and say it can't be done. Then you'll go home and do it, and it will be much better. After that comes the hard part: cutting it to three.

很少有人意识到他们写得有多糟糕。没有人向他们展示过他们的风格中到底有多少过分或者晦涩的成分，以及这些成分是如何阻碍他们想要表达的东西。如果你给我一篇八页的文章，我让你把它缩编到四页，你会嚎啕大哭，说这是不可能的。然后你就可以回家去做这件事了，这样会好很多。接下来是最困难的部分: 砍到三页。

The point is that you have to strip your writing down before you can build it back up. You must know what the essential tools are and what job they were designed to do. Extending the metaphor of carpentry, it's first necessary to be able to saw wood neatly and to drive nails. Later you can bevel the edges or add elegant finials, if that's your taste. But you can never forget that you are practicing a craft that's based on certain principles. If the nails are weak, your house will collapse. If your verbs are weak and your syntax is rickety, your sentences will fall apart.

重点是，你必须先把你的文章删除，然后才能重新写出来。你必须知道基本工具是什么，它们被设计用来做什么工作。延伸木工的比喻，首先必须能够整齐地锯木头和钉子。如果你喜欢的话，以后你可以把边缘削成斜角或者加上优雅的装饰。但是你永远不能忘记你正在练习一门基于特定原则的技艺。如果钉子不牢，你的房子就会倒塌。如果你的动词不好，句法不稳定，你的句子就会支离破碎。

I'll admit that certain nonfiction writers, like Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer, have built some remarkable houses. But these are writers who spent years learning their craft, and when at last they raised their fanciful turrets and hanging gardens, to the surprise of all of us who never dreamed of such ornamentation, they knew what they were doing. Nobody becomes Tom Wolfe overnight, not even Tom Wolfe.

我承认某些非小说作家，比如汤姆 · 沃尔夫和诺曼 · 梅勒，已经建造了一些了不起的房子。但是这些作家花费了数年时间学习他们的技艺，当他们最终建起了他们奇特的塔楼和空中花园时，让我们这些从来没有想到过这种装饰的人感到惊讶的是，他们知道他们在做什么。没有人能一夜之间成为汤姆·沃尔夫，即使是汤姆·沃尔夫自己。

First, then, learn to hammer the nails, and if what you build is sturdy and serviceable, take satisfaction in its plain strength.

首先，学会用锤子钉钉子，如果你做的东西坚固耐用，那就在它的简单有力中找到满足感吧。

But you will be impatient to find a "style"—to embellish the plain words so that readers will recognize you as someone special. You will reach for gaudy similes and tinseled adjectives, as if "style" were something you could buy at the style store and drape onto your words in bright decorator colors. (Decorator colors are the colors that decorators come in.) There is no style store; style is organic to the person doing the writing, as much a part of him as his hair, or, if he is bald, his lack of it. Trying to add style is like adding a toupee. At first glance the formerly bald man looks young and even handsome. But at second glance—and with a toupee there's always a second glance—he doesn't look quite right. The problem is not that he doesn't look well groomed; he does, and we can only admire the wigmaker's skill. The point is that he doesn't look like himself.

但是你会迫不及待地想要找到一种「风格」 ーー 美化简单的文字，这样读者就会认出你是一个特别的人。你会使用俗气的明喻和金光闪闪的形容词，就好像「风格」是你可以在时尚商店买到的东西，然后用明亮的装饰颜色把它们挂在你的文字上。(装饰颜色是装饰者加入的颜色，因此它们很显眼。) 没有可以买到风格的商店; 风格对于写作的人来说是有机的，就像他的头发一样，风格是他的一部分，或者，如果他是秃顶，他缺乏风格。试图添加风格就像添加一个假发。乍一看，这个以前秃顶的男人看上去年轻甚至英俊。但是再看第二眼 ーー 戴着假发的他总是会再看第二眼 ーー 他看起来不太对劲。问题不在于他看起来不够整洁，而是他看起来很整洁，我们可以钦佩这位假发制造者的技巧。但重点是他看起来不像他自己了。

This is the problem of writers who set out deliberately to garnish their prose. You lose whatever it is that makes you unique. The reader will notice if you are putting on airs. Readers want the person who is talking to them to sound genuine. Therefore a fundamental rule is: be yourself.

这就是那些刻意装饰自己散文的作家的问题。你失去了所有让你独一无二的东西。如果你装腔作势，读者会注意到的。读者希望与他们交谈的人听起来真诚。因此，一个基本原则就是: 做你自己。

No rule, however, is harder to follow. It requires writers to do two things that by their metabolism are impossible. They must relax, and they must have confidence.

然而，没有比这更难遵守的规则了。它要求作家做两件事情，这是他们的新陈代谢不可能做到的。他们必须放松，必须有信心。

Telling a writer to relax is like telling a man to relax while being examined for a hernia, and as for confidence, see how stiffly he sits, glaring at the screen that awaits his words. See how often he gets up to look for something to eat or drink. A writer will do anything to avoid the act of writing. I can testify from my newspaper days that the number of trips to the water cooler per reporter-hour far exceeds the body's need for fluids.

诉一个作家放松就像告诉一个男人在检查疝气的时候要放松一样，至于自信，看看他坐得有多僵硬，盯着屏幕上等着他说的话。看看他多久起来找点吃的或喝的东西。一个作家会做任何事情来避免写作的行为。我在报社工作的那些日子里可以证明，每个记者每小时去饮水机的次数远远超过了身体对液体的需求。

What can be done to put the writer out of these miseries? Unfortunately, no cure has been found. I can only offer the consoling thought that you are not alone. Some days will go better than others. Some will go so badly that you'll despair of ever writing again. We have all had many of those days and will have many more.

怎样才能使作家摆脱这些痛苦呢？ 不幸的是，还没有找到治疗方法。我只能给你一个安慰的想法，你并不孤单。有些日子会比其他日子过得好。有些会变得非常糟糕，以至于你会对再次写作感到绝望。我们都经历过许多这样的日子，而且还会经历更多。

Still, it would be nice to keep the bad days to a minimum, which brings me back to the problem of trying to relax.

尽管如此，把糟糕的日子保持在最低限度还是不错的，这让我回到了试图放松的问题上。

Assume that you are the writer sitting down to write. You think your article must be of a certain length or it won't seem important. You think how august it will look in print. You think of all the people who will read it. You think that it must have the solid weight of authority. You think that its style must dazzle. No wonder you tighten; you are so busy thinking of your awesome responsibility to the finished article that you can't even start. Yet you vow to be worthy of the task, and, casting about for grand phrases that wouldn't occur to you if you weren't trying so hard to make an impression, you plunge in.
Paragraph 1 is a disaster—a tissue of generalities that seem to have come out of a machine. No person could have written them. Paragraph 2 isn't much better. But Paragraph 3 begins to have a somewhat human quality, and by Paragraph 4 you begin to sound like yourself. You've started to relax. It s amazing how often an editor can throw away the first three or four paragraphs of an article, or even the first few pages, and start with the para.graph where the writer begins to sound like himself or herself. Not only are those first paragraphs impersonal and ornate; they don't say anything—they are a self-conscious attempt at a fancy introduction. What I'm always looking for as an editor is a sentence that says something like "I'll never forget the day when I... " I think, "Aha! A person!"

假设你是坐下来写作的作家。你认为你的文章必须有一定的长度，否则看起来不重要。你想想印出来会有多庄严。你想想所有会读这本书的人。你认为它必须有坚实的权威。你认为它的风格一定很炫。难怪你会紧缩，你忙于思考你对完成的文章的可怕的责任，以至于你甚至不能开始。然而你发誓要配得上这个任务，然后，想出一些如果你不是那么努力想给人留下深刻印象，就不会想到的华丽词句，你就一头扎进去了。第1段是一场灾难 ーー 似乎是从机器中抽取出来的一些笼统概括。没有人可以写出这些东西。第二段也好不到哪里去。但是第三段开始有点人性化，到了第四段，你听起来就像你自己了。你开始放松了。令人惊讶的是，一个编辑经常会丢掉一篇文章的前三四段，甚至前几页，而从作者开始表现自己的段落开始。这些开头的段落不仅不带个人色彩，而且很华丽; 它们什么也没有说 ーー 它们是一种自觉的花哨介绍的尝试。作为一名编辑，我一直在稿子里寻找这样的一句话: 「我永远不会忘记我…」，我想，「啊哈！终于把自己当成一个人了！」

Writers are obviously at their most natural when they write in the first person. Writing is an intimate transaction between two people, conducted on paper, and it will go well to the extent that it retains its humanity. Therefore I urge people to write in the first person: to use "I" and "me" and "we" and "us." They put up a fight.

作家用第一人称写作时显然是最自然的。写作是两个人之间的一种亲密的交流，在纸上进行，在保留其人性的程度上，写作会进行得很好。因此，我敦促人们用第一人称写作：用「我」、「我」、「我们」和「我们」。这时总有人奋起反抗。

"Who am I to say what 7 think?" they ask. "Or what / feel?"

「我凭什么说得出 7 个人的想法? 」，他们问道，「或者他们有什么样的感觉? 」

"Who are you not to say what you think?" I tell them. "There's only one you. Nobody else thinks or feels in exactly the same way."

「你凭什么不说出你的想法? 」 我告诉他们。「你只有一个人。其他人的想法和感受都不尽相同。」

"But nobody cares about my opinions," they say. "It would make me feel conspicuous." "They'll care if you tell them something interesting," I say, "and tell them in words that come naturally."

「但没人在乎我的意见，」他们说。「这会让我觉得自己很显眼。」 「如果你告诉他们一些有趣的事情，他们会很在意的」，我说，「用自然而然的语言告诉他们。」

Nevertheless, getting writers to use "I" is seldom easy. They think they must earn the right to reveal their emotions or their thoughts. Or that it's egotistical. Or that it's undignified—a fear that afflicts the academic world. Hence the professorial use of "one" ("One finds oneself not wholly in accord with Dr. Maltby's view of the human condition"), or of the impersonal "it is" ("It is to be hoped that Professor Felt's monograph will find the wider audience it most assuredly deserves"). I don't want to meet "one"—he's a boring guy. I want a professor with a passion for his subject to tell me why it fascinates him.

然而，让作者使用「我」很少是容易的。他们认为他们必须赢得权利来表达他们的情感或想法。或者说这是一种自我主义。或者说，这是有损尊严的ーー这是困扰学术界的一种恐惧。因此，教授使用了「有人」(「有人发现自己并不完全符合马尔特比博士对人类状况的看法」) ，或者客观地使用了「it is」(「希望费尔特教授的专著能够找到它确实应得的更广泛的读者」)。我不想见「one」——「有人」是个无聊的词。我想要一个对他的课题充满热情的教授告诉我为什么他会如此着迷。

I realize that there are vast regions of writing where "I" isn't allowed. Newspapers don't want "I" in their news stories; many magazines don't want it in their articles; businesses and institutions don't want it in the reports they send so profusely into the American home; colleges don't want "I" in their term papers or dissertations, and English teachers discourage any first-person pronoun except the literary "we" ("We see in Melville's symbolic use of the white whale. . . "). Many of those prohibitions are valid. Newspaper articles should consist of news, reported objectively. I also sympathize with teachers who don't want to give students an easy escape into opinion—"I think Hamlet was stupid"—before they have grappled with the discipline of assessing a work on its merits and on external sources. "I" can be a self-indulgence and a cop-out.

我意识到有大量的书写区域是不允许使用「我」的。报纸不希望在新闻报道中出现「我」 ，许多杂志不希望在文章中出现「我」 ，企业和机构不希望在他们向美国家庭大量发送的报告中出现「我」 ，大学不希望在学期论文或学位论文中出现「我」 ，英语教师不鼓励使用任何第一人称代词，除了文学上的「我们」(「我们看到梅尔维尔象征性地使用白鲸……」)。其中许多禁令是有效的。报纸文章应该包括新闻，客观报道。我也同情那些不想给学生一个轻松逃避舆论的机会的老师们 —— 「我认为哈姆雷特很愚蠢」 —— 他们在努力按照一部作品的优点和外部来源对其进行评估之前。「我」可以是一种自我放纵和逃避。

Still, we have become a society fearful of revealing who we are. The institutions that seek our support by sending us their brochures sound remarkably alike, though surely all of them— hospitals, schools, libraries, museums, zoos—were founded and are still sustained by men and women with different dreams and visions. Where are these people? It's hard to glimpse them among all the impersonal passive sentences that say "initiatives were undertaken" and "priorities have been identified."
Even when "I" isn't permitted, it's still possible to convey a sense of I-ness. The political columnist James Reston didn't use "I" in his columns; yet I had a good idea of what kind of person he was, and I could say the same of many other essayists and reporters. Good writers are visible just behind their words. If you aren't allowed to use "I," at least think "I" while you write, or write the first draft in the first person and then take the "F's out. It will warm up your impersonal style.

尽管如此，我们已经成为一个害怕暴露自己的社会。通过给我们寄来宣传册寻求我们支持的机构听起来非常相似，尽管所有这些机构 —— 医院、学校、图书馆、博物馆、动物园 —— 都是由有着不同梦想和愿景的男性和女性创立的，并且仍在维持着。这些人在哪里？ 我们很难从所有不带个人色彩的被动句中瞥见他们，这些被动句表示「已经采取了主动行动」和「已经确定了优先事项」 即使「我」是不被允许的，它仍然可以传达一种我的感觉。政治专栏作家詹姆斯 · 莱斯顿在他的专栏里没有使用「我」这个词，但是我知道他是一个什么样的人，我可以对其他许多作家和记者说同样的话。好的作家在他们的文字背后是显而易见的。如果你不被允许使用「我」 ，至少在你写的时候想想「我」 ，或者用第一人称写第一稿，然后把「I」去掉。这会使你的客观风格变得温和起来。

Style is tied to the psyche, and writing has deep psychological roots. The reasons why we express ourselves as we do, or fail to express ourselves because of "writer's block," are partly buried in the subconscious mind. There are as many kinds of writers block as there are kinds of writers, and I have no intention of trying to untangle them. This is a short book, and my name isn't Sigmund Freud.

风格与心理紧密相连，写作有着深厚的心理根源。我们这样表达自己的原因，或者因为「写作障碍」而不能表达自己的原因，部分地埋藏在潜意识里。写作障碍的种类和写作者的种类一样多，我无意去研究它们的解法。这是一本很短的书，我的名字不是西格蒙德·弗洛伊德。

But I've also noticed a new reason for avoiding "I": Americans are unwilling to go out on a limb. A generation ago our leaders told us where they stood and what they believed. Today they perform strenuous verbal feats to escape that fate. Watch them wriggle through TV interviews without committing themselves. I remember President Ford assuring a group of visiting businessmen that his fiscal policies would work. He said: "We see nothing but increasingly brighter clouds every month." I took this to mean that the clouds were still fairly dark. Ford's sentence was just vague enough to say nothing and still sedate his constituents.

但我也注意到了一个回避「我」的新理由: 美国人不愿意冒险。一代人以前，我们的领导人告诉我们他们的立场和信仰。今天，他们用激烈的语言表演来逃避这个使命。看着他们在电视采访中扭动身体，却没有做出任何承诺。我记得福特总统向一群来访的商人保证，他的财政政策会奏效。他说: 「我们每个月只能看到越来越亮的云。」 我认为这意味着云层仍然相当黑暗。福特的说法含糊不清，一句话也不说，仍然让选民们感到镇定。

Later administrations brought no relief. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, assessing a Polish crisis in 1984, said: "There's continuing ground for serious concern and the situation remains serious. The longer it remains serious, the more ground there is for serious concern." President Bush, questioned about his stand on assault rifles in 1989, said: "There are various groups that think you can ban certain kinds of guns. I am not in that mode. I am in the mode of being deeply concerned."

后来的政府没有带来任何缓解。在评估1984年的波兰危机时，国防部长卡斯帕．温伯格说: 「我们仍然有理由严重关切，形势依然严峻。危机持续的时间越长，引起严重关切的理由就越多。」 布什总统在1989年被问及他对突击步枪的立场时说: 「有各种各样的团体认为可以禁止某些种类的枪支。我不是那种人。我正处于深切关注的状态。」

But my all-time champ is Elliot Richardson, who held four major cabinet positions in the 1970s. It's hard to know where to begin picking from his trove of equivocal statements, but con.sider this one: "And yet, on balance, affirmative action has, I think, been a qualified success." A 13-word sentence with five hedging words. I give it first prize as the most wishy-washy sentence in modern public discourse, though a rival would be his analysis of how to ease boredom among assembly-line workers: "And so, at last, I come to the one firm conviction that I mentioned at the beginning: it is that the subject is too new for final judgments."

但是我的总冠军是艾略特·理查森，他在20世纪70年代担任过4个主要的内阁职位。很难知道从他那些模棱两可的陈述中该从哪里开始挑选，不过请考虑一下这一点: 「然而，总的来说，我认为平权法案已经取得了一定程度的成功。」 一个13个单词的句子，包含5个模糊限制词。我把它评为当代公共话语中最空泛的一个句子，尽管对手可能是他对如何缓解装配线工人无聊情绪的分析: 「因此，最后，我坚信我在开头提到的一点: 这个主题太新了，无法做出最终判断。」

That's a firm conviction? Leaders who bob and weave like aging boxers don't inspire confidence—or deserve it. The same thing is true of writers. Sell yourself, and your subject will exert its own appeal. Believe in your own identity and your own opinions. Writing is an act of ego, and you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep yourself going.

这是一个坚定的信念？ 像上了年纪的拳击手那样跳来跳去的领导者不会激发自信，或者说不配拥有自信。同样的道理也适用于作家。推销自己，你的主题就会发挥它自己的吸引力。相信你自己的身份和你自己的观点。写作是一种自我行为，你不妨承认这一点。利用它的能量让自己继续前进。
