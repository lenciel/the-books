When I first wrote this book, in 1976, the readers I had in mind were a relatively small segment of the population: students, writ­ers, editors and people who wanted to learn to write. I wrote it on a typewriter, the highest technology then available. I had no inkling of the electronic marvels just around the comer that were about to revolutionize the act of writing. First came the word processor, in the 1980s, which made the computer an everyday tool for people who had never thought of themselves as writers. Then came the Internet and e-mail, in the 1990s, which com­pleted the revolution. Today everybody in the world is writing to everybody else, keeping in touch and doing business across every border and time zone.

1976年，当我第一次写这本书的时候，我心目中的读者只是人口中相对较小的一部分: 学生、作家、编辑和那些想学习写作的人。 我用打字机写的，那是当时最先进的技术。 我对即将彻底改变写作行为的电子奇迹一无所知。 首先出现的是文字处理器，在20世纪80年代，这使得计算机成为那些从未想过自己是作家的人们的日常工具。 然后是互联网和电子邮件，在20世纪90年代，完成了这场革命。 今天，世界上的每个人都在给其他人写信，保持联系，做生意，跨越边界和时区。

To me this is nothing less than a miracle, curing overnight what appeared to be a deep American disorder. I’ve been repeatedly told by people in non-writing occupations-especially people in science, technology, medicine, business and finance-that they hat writing and can’t write and don’t want to be made to write. One thing they particularly didn’t want to write was letters. Just getting started on a letter loomed as a chore with so many formalities-Where’s the stationery? Where’s the envelope? Where’s the stamp?-that they would keep putting it off, and when they finally did sit down to write they would spend the entire first paragraph explaining why they hadn’t written sooner.

对我来说，这简直是一个奇迹，一夜之间治愈了似乎是美国深层次的疾病。 从事非写作行业的人——尤其是科学、技术、医学、商业和金融领域的人——一再告诉我，他们会写作，不会写作，也不想被逼写作。 有一件事他们特别不想写，那就是信。 刚开始写一封信就成了繁琐的手续——信纸在哪里？ 信封在哪儿？ 邮票在哪里？ 他们会一直拖延，当他们最终坐下来写的时候，他们会用整个第一段来解释为什么他们没有早点写。

In the second paragraph they would describe the weather in their part of the country-a subject of no interest anywhere else. Only in the third paragraph would they begin to relax and say what they wanted to say.

在第二段中，他们将描述他们所在地区的天气——这是其他任何地方都不感兴趣的话题。 只有到了第三段，他们才开始放松下来，想说什么就说什么。

Then along came e-mail and all the formalities went away. E-mail has no etiquette. It doesn’t require stationery, or neatness, or proper spelling, or preliminary chitchat. E-mail writers are like people who stop a friend on the sidewalk and say, “Did you see the game last night?” WHAP! No amenities. They just start typ­ing at full speed. So here’s the miracle: All those people who said they hate writing and can’t write and don’t want to write can write and do want to write. In fact, they can’t be turned off. Never have so many Americans written so profusely and with so few inhibi­tions. Which means that it wasn’t a cognitive problem after all. It was a cultural problem, rooted in that old bugaboo of American education: fear.

然后就有了电子邮件，所有的手续都不用办了。 电子邮件没有礼节。 它不需要文具，不需要整洁，不需要正确的拼写，也不需要初步的闲聊。 电子邮件作者就像人们在人行道上拦住一个朋友说: “你昨晚看比赛了吗? ” 哇！ 没有便利设施。 他们开始全速打字。 所以这就是奇迹: 所有那些说他们讨厌写作，不会写作，不想写作的人都能写作，而且确实想写作。 事实上，它们无法被关闭。 从来没有这么多的美国人写得这么丰富，而且没有什么顾忌。 这就意味着这根本不是一个认知问题。 这是一个文化问题，根源于美国教育的老毛病: 恐惧。

Fear of writing gets planted in American schoolchildren at an early age, especially children of scientific or technical or mechan­ical bent. They are led to believe that writing is a special language owned by the English teacher, available only to the humanistic few who have “a gift for words.” But writing isn’t a skill that some people are born with and others aren’t, like a gift for art or music. Writing is talking to someone else on paper. Anybody who can think clearly can write clearly, about any subject at all. That has always been the central premise of this book.

对写作的恐惧在美国的学龄儿童中早已根深蒂固，尤其是那些具有科学、技术或机械倾向的孩子。 他们被引导去相信写作是英语老师所拥有的一种特殊的语言，只有少数有“文字天赋”的人文主义者才能使用 但是写作并不像艺术或音乐的天赋那样，是一种有些人与生俱来而有些人不具备的技能。 写作就是在纸上和别人交谈。 任何思维清晰的人都可以清楚地写出任何主题。 这一直是本书的核心前提。

On one level, therefore, the new fluency created by e-mail is terrific news. Any invention that eliminates the fear of writing is up there with air conditioning and the lightbulb. But, as always, there’s a catch. Nobody told all the new e-mail writers that the essence of writing is rewriting. Just because they are writing with ease and enjoyment doesn’t mean they are writing well.

因此，从某种程度上来说，电子邮件带来的新的流畅性是个好消息。 任何消除对写作的恐惧的发明都与空气调节和灯泡同在。 但是，和往常一样，这里也有一个陷阱。 没有人告诉所有新的电子邮件作者写作的本质是重写。 仅仅因为他们轻松愉快地写作并不意味着他们写得很好。

That condition was first revealed in the 1980s, when people began writing on word processors. Two opposite things hap­pened. The word processor made good writers better and bad writers worse. Good writers know that very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time or the fifth time. For them the word processor was a rare gift, enabling them to fuss endlessly with their sentences—cutting and revising and reshaping-without the drudgery of retyping. Bad writers became even more verbose because writing was suddenly so easy and their sentences looked so pretty on the screen. How could such beautiful sentences not be perfect?

这种情况在20世纪80年代首次被发现，当时人们开始使用文字处理器写作。 两件相反的事情发生了。 文字处理器使好的作家写得更好，而使坏的作家写得更差。 优秀的作家知道，很少有句子在第一次，甚至第三次或第五次出来的正确。 对他们来说，文字处理是一种罕见的天赋，使他们能够对自己的句子无休止地大惊小怪——剪切、修改和重塑——而不用再打字这种苦差事。 糟糕的作家变得更加冗长，因为写作突然变得如此简单，而且他们的句子在屏幕上看起来如此漂亮。 这么漂亮的句子怎么会不完美呢？

E-mail pushed that verbosity to a new extreme: chatter unlim­ited. It’s a spontaneous medium, not conducive to slowing down or looking back. That makes it ideal for the never-ending upkeep of personal life: maintaining contact with far-flung children and grand­ children and friends and long-lost classmates. If the writing is often garrulous or disorganized or not quite clear, no real harm is done.

电子邮件把这种冗长推向了一个新的极端: 无限的闲聊。 这是一种自发的媒介，不利于放慢脚步或回头看。 这使得它成为永无止境的个人生活维护的理想场所: 与遥远的孩子、孙子、朋友和久违的同学保持联系。 如果文字经常是饶舌的、杂乱无章的或者不是很清楚，没有真正的伤害是造成的。

But e-mail is also where much of the world’s business is now conducted. Millions of e-mail messages every day give people the information they need to do their job, and a badly written mes­sage can cause a lot of damage. Employers have begun to realize that they literally cannot afford to hire men and women who can’t write sentences that are tight and logical and clear. The new information age, for all its high-tech gadgetry, is, finally, writing­ based. E-mail, the Internet and the fax are all forms of writing, and writing is, finally, a craft, with its own set of tools, which are words. Like all tools, they have to be used right.

但电子邮件也是目前全球大部分业务的处理场所。 每天都有数以百万计的电子邮件为人们提供工作所需的信息，而一封写得很糟糕的邮件可能会造成很大的伤害。 雇主们已经开始意识到他们实际上无法雇佣那些不能写出紧凑、逻辑和清晰的句子的人。 新的信息时代，尽管有各种各样的高科技设备，但最终还是以写作为基础。 电子邮件、互联网和传真都是书写的形式，而书写最终是一门手艺，有它自己的一套工具，那就是文字。 像所有的工具一样，它们必须正确使用。

On Writing Well is a craft book. That’s what I set out to write 25 years ago-a book that would teach the craft of writing warmly and clearly-and its principles have never changed; they are as valid. in the digital age as they were in the age of the typewriter. I don’t mean that the book itself hasn’t changed. I’ve revised and expanded it five times since 1976 to keep pace with new trends in the language and in society: a far greater interest in memoir­ writing, for instance, and in writing about business and science and sports, and in nonfiction writing by women and by newcom­ers to the United States from other cultural traditions.

写得好》是一本手工书。 这就是我25年前开始着手写的东西——一本能够温暖而清晰地教授写作技巧的书——它的原则从未改变; 它们同样有效。 就像打字机时代一样。 我并不是说这本书本身没有改变。 自1976年以来，为了跟上语言和社会的新趋势，我对它进行了五次修订和扩充: 比如，我对写回忆录、写商业、科学和体育方面的文章，以及对女性和来自其他文化传统的新移民的非小说写作更感兴趣。

I’m also not the same person I was 25 years ago. Books that teach, if they have a long life, should reflect who the writer has become at later stages of his own long life-what he has been doing and thinking about. On Writing Well and I have grown older and wiser together. In each of the five new editions the new material consisted of things I had learned since the previous edi­tion by continuing to wrestle with the craft as a writer. As a teacher, I’ve become far more preoccupied with the intangibles of the craft-the attitudes and values, like enjoyment and confi­dence and intention, that keep us going and produce our best work. But it wasn’t until the sixth edition that I knew enough to write the two chapters (21 and 22) that deal at proper length with those attitudes and values.

我也不再是25年前的我了。 教书的书，如果它们有很长的生命，应该反映作家在他漫长人生的后期成为了什么样的人——他一直在做什么，在思考什么。 关于“写得好” ，我和他一起变得更成熟、更聪明。 在五个新版本中的每一个版本中，新的材料都包含了我自上一版以来通过作为一个作家继续与技艺搏斗而学到的东西。 作为一名教师，我更加专注于无形的技艺——态度和价值观，比如享受、信心和意图，它们让我们坚持下去，创造出最好的作品。 但是直到第六版，我才知道如何用适当的篇幅来写这两章(21章和22章)来阐述这些态度和价值观。

Ultimately, however, good writing rests on craft and always will. I don’t know what still newer electronic marvels are waiting just around the comer to make writing twice as easy and twice as fast in the next 25 years. But I do know they won’t make writing twice as good. That will still require plain old hard work-dear thinking-and the plain old tools of the English language.

然而，好的写作最终取决于技巧，而且永远都是如此。 我不知道在接下来的25年里，还有什么更新的电子奇迹在等着我们让写作变得两倍容易，两倍快。 但我知道他们不会让写作变得更好。 这仍然需要简单而古老的努力工作——亲爱的思考——以及简单而古老的英语工具。
